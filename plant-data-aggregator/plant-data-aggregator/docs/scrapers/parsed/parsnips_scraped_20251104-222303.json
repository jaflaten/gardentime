  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting\nPlant parsnips in a sunny area with loose soil that drains well and is free of rocks. As with carrots, clay or compacted soils can cause parsnip roots to be thin and misshapen. Make sure the area is clear of weeds. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches and mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost or aged manure for fertility. When to Plant Parsnips Parsnips need a long growing season, so sow seeds as soon as the soil is workable in the spring. Parsnip seeds will germinate in soil temperatures as low as 48°F (9°C), but ideally soil at 50º to 54ºF (10° to 12°C) will speed germination. How to Plant Parsnips Don’t plant where sod grew in the previous season. Excess nitrogen in the soil will cause overabundant top growth and poor root development. Consider doing a soil test. Always sow fresh seed. Parsnip seeds do not store well and seeds that are more than a year old will have a reduced germination rate. Sow seeds directly in the garden. Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep, 1 inch apart, in rows 18 to 24 inches wide. Tip: Sow radish seeds in between your parsnip seedings. Radishes will grow quickly, marking the row and breaking the dirt’s crust for the parsnips. Parsnips are slow to germinate. Seedlings typically emerge in 2 to 3 weeks, or longer in soil temperatures below 50°F (10°C). To hasten the process, keep the soil moist. Tip: Another way to speed up germination is to start by soaking paper towels or cotton wool pads. Place them on a saucer and press papery parsnip seeds into them. Keep the seeds warm (50º to 54ºF) and watch for little white roots to appear. Then sow as described. Discard any seeds that fail.\n\n### When to Plant Parsnips\nParsnips need a long growing season, so sow seeds as soon as the soil is workable in the spring.

  "careInstructions" : "### Growing\nOnce seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin them so that they’re spaced 3 to 4 inches apart. To avoid disturbing the delicate roots of the remaining seedlings, simply snip off the tops; do not pull seedlings. Use row covers to deter pests such as carrot rust flies. Always keep the beds free of weeds, especially when plants are young. Mulching suppresses seeds and retains moisture. Water in summer if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week. Parsnips need a fair amount of moisture to form healthy roots. As long as you started with good soil, fertilizing is likely not necessary. Excess nitrogen will encourage top growth instead of root growth. Once roots start to form, hill soil around the plants’ base to prevent greening of the roots’ shoulders. Note: Be careful about handling parsnips, as the sap and/or leaves can be irritating to the skin. Wear long pants, long sleeves, and gloves when weeding or harvesting.\n\n### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Potatoes\n\n\n### How to Grow Rutabagas: Planting, Care & Harvest Guide\n\n\n### How to Grow Carrots: Planting, Growing & Harvesting Tips for Sweet Roots\n\n\n### How to Grow Kohlrabi: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Tips\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Harvesting\nParsnips mature in about 16 weeks after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest when roots are at least 1 inch in diameter. When exposed to near-freezing temperatures for 2 to 4 weeks in the fall/early winter, the starch in the root changes into sugar, resulting in a strong, sweet, unique taste. Leave your parsnips in the ground for a few frosts, but harvest before the ground freezes. Or leave them in the ground for the entire winter, covered with a thick layer of mulch. Harvest immediately after the ground thaws in the spring, before top growth starts. If a flower stalk develops, roots may turn woody. Credit: Deyan Georgiev/Shutterstock How to Store Parsnips Before storing parsnips, trim foliage down to 2 to 3 inches. Store parsnips between 32 and 35°F (0 and 2°C), with a humidity of 90 to 95%. For longer-term storage (4 to 6 months), store roots in slightly damp sand, sawdust, or leaves.\n\n### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Potatoes\n\n\n### How to Grow Rutabagas: Planting, Care & Harvest Guide\n\n\n### How to Grow Carrots: Planting, Growing & Harvesting Tips for Sweet Roots\n\n\n### How to Grow Kohlrabi: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Sweet Potatoes: Planting Slips & Harvesting Tips\n",

Let’s root for&nbsp;parsnips!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Parsnips</h2><p><strong>Parsnips</strong>, popular with ancient Greeks and Romans, were brought over to the Americas with the first colonists. A relative of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/carrots\">carrots</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/parsley\">parsley</a>, parsnips are biennials even though they&#8217;re usually grown as annual&nbsp;vegetables.&nbsp;</p><p>Parsnips need a long growing season and are best harvested after a few fall&nbsp;frosts; if planted too late in the season, their roots will be&nbsp;small.&nbsp;</p><p>Parsnips lend a nutty, sweet flavor to any dish, but these root vegetables can also be enjoyed by themselves as a side dish. (Roasting is a favored method!) Plus, they are packed with nutrients, like&nbsp;potassium and vitamins <span class=\"caps\">B6</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;C.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0IwvuoKm0E?si=hVwyJp6kBsK1XIff\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-3b4685809a288e74c46e15187885bf822846e1b19d4a4c32a4c5c5922461c001\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/potatoes\" hreflang=\"und\">Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Potatoes</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/rutabagas\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Rutabagas: Planting, Care &amp; Harvest Guide</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/carrots\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Carrots: Planting, Growing &amp; Harvesting Tips for Sweet Roots</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        <p>Plant parsnips in a sunny area with loose soil that drains well and is free of rocks. As with carrots, clay or compacted soils can cause parsnip roots to be thin and misshapen.&nbsp;Make sure the area is clear of weeds.&nbsp;Loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches and mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost or aged manure for&nbsp;fertility.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Parsnips</h3><p>Parsnips need a long growing season, so sow seeds as soon as the soil is workable in the spring.&nbsp;Parsnip seeds will germinate in soil temperatures&nbsp;as low as 48°F (9°C), but ideally soil at 50º to 54ºF (10° to 12°C) will speed&nbsp;germination.</p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Parsnips</h3><p>Don’t plant where sod grew in the previous season. Excess nitrogen in the soil will cause overabundant top growth and poor root development. Consider doing a soil test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Always sow fresh seed. Parsnip seeds do not store well and seeds that are more than a year old will have a reduced germination&nbsp;rate.</li><li>Sow seeds directly in&nbsp;the&nbsp;garden.</li><li>Sow seeds&nbsp;1/2 inch deep, 1 inch apart,&nbsp;in rows 18 to 24 inches wide.<ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong> Sow <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/radishes\">radish </a>seeds in between your parsnip seedings. Radishes will grow quickly, marking the row and breaking the dirt’s crust for the&nbsp;parsnips.</li></ul></li><li>Parsnips are slow to germinate. Seedlings typically emerge in 2 to 3 weeks, or longer in soil temperatures below 50°F (10°C).&nbsp;To hasten the process, keep the soil moist.<ul><li><strong>Tip: </strong>Another way to speed up germination is to start by soaking&nbsp;paper towels or cotton wool pads. &nbsp;Place them on a saucer and press papery parsnip seeds into them. Keep the seeds warm (50º to 54ºF) and watch for little white roots to appear. Then sow as described. Discard any seeds that&nbsp;fail.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/parsnips-side_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"harvested parsnips in a basket\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Once seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin them so that they&#8217;re spaced&nbsp;3 to 4&nbsp;inches apart.

Mulching suppresses seeds and retains&nbsp;moisture.</li><li>Water in summer if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week. Parsnips need a fair amount of moisture to form healthy&nbsp;roots.</li><li>As long as you started with good soil, fertilizing is likely not necessary.&nbsp;Excess nitrogen will encourage&nbsp;top growth instead of root&nbsp;growth.</li><li>Once roots start to form, hill soil around the plants’ base to prevent greening of the roots’&nbsp;shoulders.</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>Be careful about handling parsnips, as the sap and/or leaves can be irritating to the skin.

I did not soak. Had them in raised bed with glass cover initially, and we had some hot temps.  A week or so ago a few of the Hollow Crown variety popped up. Today is 28 days - the longest expected for germination. I planned to plant some parsley and carrots where the parsnips did not appear. Lo and behold, today, one lone Harris variety is showing. Should I keep waiting?  Might I have burned seed? I think the soil was about perfect in terms of watering.  Should I plant more parsnip seed - I may be out of seed now - germination was not good earlier in the season either. I am hopeful.

This winter we have had -30F, lots of snow and near summer weather. I regularly leave my parsnips in the ground for the winter and never extra cover. I have done this for over thirty years and everyone has been successful for great feasts of parsnips. I usually grow Harris parsnip brand from Vesseys in PEI, Canada . Often some are over 41/2 diameter and 30\" long. I have never had a woody one. The ones over 20\" are usually to small to use but the dogs definitely use the small pieces and love them . There is always lot to share with friends and family. I can prove the sizes with pictures.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-99874\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"91712\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Krayna Feinberg&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Thu, 08/09/2018 - 20:50</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"91712\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90094\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      We have parsnips growing in our garden that I want to leave in the ground until it is cold, but the above ground growth is very tall and might be about to flower.
