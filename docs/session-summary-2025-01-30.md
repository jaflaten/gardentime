## Issue Fixed: Database Schema Validation Error

### Problem
Backend failed to start with schema validation error:
```
Schema-validation: wrong column type encountered in column [latitude] in table [garden_climate_info]; 
found [numeric (Types#NUMERIC)], but expecting [float(53) (Types#FLOAT)]
```

### Root Cause
Mismatch between database schema and JPA entity mapping:
- **Database (V7 migration):** `latitude DECIMAL(9,6)` → PostgreSQL NUMERIC type
- **Entity (GardenClimateInfo.kt):** `latitude: Double?` → Expects PostgreSQL FLOAT type

### Solution
Changed entity and DTOs to use `BigDecimal` instead of `Double`:

**Files Updated:**
1. `src/main/kotlin/no/sogn/gardentime/model/GardenClimateInfo.kt`
   - Changed `latitude: Double?` → `latitude: BigDecimal?`
   - Changed `longitude: Double?` → `longitude: BigDecimal?`
   - Added precision/scale annotations: `@Column(name = "latitude", precision = 9, scale = 6)`

2. `src/main/kotlin/no/sogn/gardentime/dto/SeasonPlanningDto.kt`
   - Updated `GardenClimateInfoDTO` to use `BigDecimal?` for lat/long
   - Updated `CreateGardenClimateInfoDTO` to use `BigDecimal?` for lat/long

### Result
✅ Backend builds successfully  
✅ No more schema validation errors  
✅ Ready to continue with Step 69 implementation

## Current Project Status

### Completed Features
Based on the documentation review:

**Garden Management Dashboard (Step 64)** - ✅ COMPLETED
- Dashboard route: `/gardens/[id]` (default view when opening a garden)
- 7 widgets implemented:
  - Garden Summary Card
  - Active Crops Widget
  - Recent Harvests Widget
  - Upcoming Tasks Widget
  - Garden Capacity Widget
  - Planting Calendar Widget (mini)
  - Modern navigation menu (Dashboard | Grow Areas | Board)

**Canvas Features (Steps 25-27)** - ✅ 85% COMPLETE
- All drawing tools (rectangle, circle, line, arrow, text, freehand)
- Properties panel with color pickers, opacity, stroke width
- Multi-select with bulk operations
- Undo/Redo system
- Copy/Paste functionality
- Mini-map overview
- Keyboard shortcuts with help modal
- Auto-save with debouncing
- Snap-to-grid
- Display current crops on grow areas
- Add crop from canvas

### Ready to Implement

**Step 69: Season Planning & Planting Calendar** - ⭐ PRIORITY
This is the core feature that makes GardenTime invaluable to gardeners.

**Why it matters:**
- Many crops need indoor seed starting 6-8 weeks before last frost
- Gardeners struggle to remember when to start seeds
- Manual frost date tracking is error-prone
- Users need reminders and guidance

**What's already in place:**
- ✅ Database migrations (V7) created
  - `garden_climate_info` table for frost dates
  - `season_plans` table for organizing crops by season
  - `planned_crops` table for tracking planting timeline
  - `plant_details` table for plant-specific growing info
- ✅ Backend models created
  - `GardenClimateInfo`, `SeasonPlan`, `PlannedCrop`, `PlantDetails`
- ✅ Basic API endpoints in `SeasonPlanningController`
- ✅ PlantingDateCalculator service for date calculations
- ✅ 20 common plants ready to load (see `/docs/placeholder-plant-data.sql`)

**What needs to be built:**
See detailed breakdown in `/docs/garden-management-dashboard-spec.md` Step 69

**Frontend pages:**
1. Season plan creation page (`/gardens/[id]/season-plan/new`)
2. Season plan management page (`/gardens/[id]/season-plan`)
3. Add planned crop modal with calculated dates
4. Full calendar view (`/gardens/[id]/calendar`)
5. Indoor seed starting alerts widget

**Backend work:**
- Enhance API endpoints for calendar events
- Improve PlantingDateCalculator edge cases
- Load placeholder plant data
- Test frost date calculations

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with Step 69 (Season Planning) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
This is the highest-value feature for users and builds on the completed dashboard.

**Time estimate:** 2-3 weeks  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**User value:** Very High  

**Approach:**
1. Load placeholder plant data (30 min)
2. Build season plan creation UI (2-3 days)
3. Build add planned crop modal with date calculations (2-3 days)
4. Build calendar view (3-4 days)
5. Integrate with crop records (1-2 days)
6. Test and refine (2-3 days)

See `/docs/dashboard-quick-start.md` for day-by-day breakdown.

### Option 2: Complete Remaining Canvas Features
Finish Steps 25.7, 27.13-27.18 for a fully polished canvas experience.

**Time estimate:** 1-2 weeks  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**User value:** Medium  

### Option 3: Crop Record Management (Steps 60-63)
Build centralized crop list, timeline view, batch operations, export.

**Time estimate:** 1-2 weeks  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**User value:** High

## Notes

### Garden Navigation Modernization ✅
The dashboard now includes a professional navigation menu:
- Dashboard (default view)
- Grow Areas (list view)
- Board (canvas view)

This replaced the old "Board View" button approach with a clean, modern menu.

### Testing Queue
There are 60+ test TODOs in `todo.md` covering:
- Dashboard widgets
- Canvas features (undo/redo, copy/paste, mini-map, keyboard shortcuts)
- Multi-select and bulk operations
- Crop display on board
- All drawing tools

Consider scheduling a testing session to validate all recent features.
