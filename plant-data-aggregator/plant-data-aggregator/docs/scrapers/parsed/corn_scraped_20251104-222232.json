  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Sweet Corn\n\n\n### Planting\nThe most common reasons for slow growth include poor light levels, not enough moisture, or a lack of nutrients. Plant in full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight). Soil needs to be consistently moist (though well-draining), as corn tends to suck up a lot of water. Corn is a hungry plant, so it’s important to enrich beds with lots of organic matter, such as garden compost (ideally in the fall). When to Plant Corn Most gardeners sow corn directly in the garden soil (versus indoors) so that their sensitive roots aren’t disturbed when transplanting. Corn is very sensitive to frost; do not plant soil temperature is at least 60°F (16°C), or 65°F (18°C) for supersweet varieties. Usually, this is 2 or 3 weeks after the last frost in spring. See our Planting Calendar for corn based on average frost dates. If you live in an area with a shorter growing season, choose an early variety that will mature well before the first fall frost. The ground can be warmed by a black plastic cover; sow seeds through holes in the plastic. A couple of weeks after planting your first round of corn, plant another round in order to extend the harvest. How to Plant Corn To speed germination, moisten seeds, wrap them in moist paper towels, and store them in a plastic bag for 24 hours. Because corn is wind-pollinated, it’s essential to plant in a block, rather than a single row. For decent pollination, we recommend a modest block of, say, 10 to 50 plants. This maximizes the chances of the pollen released from the male tassels at the top of the plants drifting down into contact with the female silks lower down. Incomplete or inconsistent kernel development, with the cobs only partly or sporadically filled, is down to poor pollination. The silks protruding from the end of each cob are responsible for carrying the pollen down to the kernels. One strand connects to one kernel, so for complete fill, every strand of the silk must be pollinated. Sow seeds about 1½ to 2 inches deep and 12 inches apart in rows 2½ to 3 feet apart. Don’t plant too close together or you run the risk of disappointingly small cobs. You may choose to fertilize at planting time with a general purpose (10-10-10 fertilizer); corn is meant to grow rapidly. Water well at planting time. Sowing Corn Indoors If you’re going to start seeds early, sow the seeds in pots under the protection of a greenhouse, hoop house, or cold frame. This means you can begin sowing three to four weeks before your last frost date, giving you a head start on corn sown outdoors—a huge advantage for areas with shorter growing seasons. Sow eight to ten seeds 1/2 inch deep into 4-inch-wide pots, or sow two seeds per module in a plug tray and remove the weakest of the two seedlings when they emerge. Keep the potting soil moist as they grow on. Harden off the plants as your recommended planting time approaches by placing them outside for increasingly longer spells over the course of about a week. Plants should be at least 6 inches tall by the time they’re transplanted outdoors.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Sweet Corn\n\n\n### Growing\nConsistent moisture will encourage bigger, fatter ears of corn, so it’s hard to over-emphasize the importance of this. Keep corn well watered, as it has shallow roots and can become stressed by drought. About 2 inches of water per week is sufficient; water more if conditions are especially hot or if your soil is sandy. If the soil remains dry, soak the soil again. When watering, aim at the base of plants to avoid problems with fungal diseases. Mulch helps to reduce evaporation around the plants. Corn’s roots are shallow and can easily be damaged by hoeing. Instead, weed your corn by hand for as long as you’re still able to get between the plants without damaging them. Then, apply several inches of mulch. Corn sometimes produces aerial roots a few inches above the soil. These are not meant to absorb water or nutrients but rather to stabilize the tall stalk. If this happens, mound soil up over the roots to keep them covered, or just cover the whole area with a mulch of compost, which will help feed the plants, too. Support stalks in windy places. Mounding the soil around the base of 12-inch-tall plants will help. If you do notice plants getting rocked about in the wind, consider tying them to stakes. Wind pollination is critical to developing full cobs of kernels. To help this along, gently shake the stalks of the plants every few days for as long as the tassels are viable to increase the chances of every silk being pollinated. Mornings are best. Learn more about corn pollination, including how to hand-pollinate to guarantee pollination success. Watch for signs of nitrogen deficiency (yellowing leaves) and respond with quick side-dressings of a nitrogen-rich fertilizer such as fish emulsion. Note: Tillers, or “suckers,” are secondary shoots that may develop low on the stalk later in the season. They do not adversely affect the main stalk.",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Sweet Corn\n\n\n### Harvesting\nThe warmer the air, the more quickly corn matures. It is usually ripe about 15 to 23 days after silking and sooner if temperatures are exceptionally high. When two ears grow on a stalk, the upper ear matures 1 to 2 days before the lower one. At harvest, ears should be rounded or blunt, not pointed, with tassels turning brown and kernels full and milky. To test, pull down some husk and pierce a kernel with a fingernail. If it’s white, or milky, it’s ready. The milk stage is brief; in hot weather (over 85°F/29°C), sweet corn is at peak for only 1 to 2 days, so check it frequently. Corn harvested a few days after milk stage will not be as sweet. Pull ears downward and twist to remove from stalk. Sweet corn varieties (except for supersweet varieties) lose their sweetness soon after harvest. Immediately after picking, prepare the ears for eating or preservation. Prepare for eating or preserving immediately after picking. Enjoy your harvested corncobs as soon as you can. The quicker they’re cooked, the sweeter they will be! If immature corn suffers a late-season frost, the plants and cobs can be damaged and result in the death of the plant or poor-tasting corn. How to Store Corn Sweet corn freezes well, especially if removed from ears before freezing. Learn how to properly freeze corn. Corn can also be harvested for other purposes!",

We’re talking about the sweet corn of your dreams, not the kind with sad little gaps where kernels <em data-start=\"720\" data-end=\"728\">should</em> be. To get those perfect cobs, you’ll need more than just sunshine—you’ll need smart planting and solid pollination. But don’t worry, we’ve got your back! From picking the right seeds to planting in blocks (not rows!) and knowing exactly when to harvest, this guide will help you grow corn that’s golden in every way. Let’s get&nbsp;popping!</p><h2>About Sweet&nbsp;Corn</h2><p>Sweet corn is a tender, warm-season annual crop that produces ears of yellow, white, or bi-colored kernels. Native to the Americas, sweet corn has been cultivated for thousands of years; it&#8217;s famous as&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/three-sisters-corn-bean-and-squash\">Three Sisters</a>—corn, beans, and squash—grown by Native&nbsp;Americans.</p><p><a class=\"text-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/42FH8eZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Seeds&nbsp;Now</a></p><p>A long, frost-free growing season (60 to 100 frost-free days) is necessary to grow and harvest corn. Don&#8217;t be tempted to sow too early, though. Mid to late spring is just fine once any chance of frosts is long&nbsp;gone.</p><p>And corn is a grass! A member of the<em> </em>Poaceae family, corn relies on wind, not bees or insects, to pollinate its flowers. This is why we&nbsp;plant corn in blocks of short rows&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;long,&nbsp;single&nbsp;rows.&nbsp;</p><h3>Types of Sweet&nbsp;Corn</h3><p>For a continuous supply of sweet corn, plant early, mid-season, and late varieties or plant every 2 or 3 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Have you ever had the intensely disappointing experience of tucking into a juicy-looking sweet corn cob only to find it tastes bland? This is the number one reason why paying a little bit more for your seeds pays big dividends. Hybrid or <span class=\"caps\">F1</span> varieties of sweet corn may cost a bit more, but they’re worth every penny, yielding cobs with a superior flavor, especially if you pick one of the supersweet types. Varieties bred for sweetness hold their taste for longer, too, but the sooner you cook them after picking, the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Learn more about the different varieties of corn&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-ebf42ed0f4d7d445269addb625f09aeb12e0df784ad05c4b3b6c8e15c1313732\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/cornucopia-corn-facts\" hreflang=\"und\">A Cornucopia of Corn Facts</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/cooks-garden-corn-okra-shallots\" hreflang=\"und\">A Cook&#039;s Garden: Corn, Okra, Shallots</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/how-freeze-corn-blanching-and-freezing-corn-cob\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Freeze Corn: Blanching and Freezing Corn on the Cob</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n        <p>The most common reasons for slow growth include poor light levels, not enough moisture, or a lack of nutrients. Plant in full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight). Soil needs to be consistently moist (though well-draining), as corn tends to suck up a lot of water. Corn is a hungry plant, so it’s important to enrich beds with lots of organic matter, such as garden compost (ideally in the&nbsp;fall).</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Corn</h3><ul><li>Most gardeners sow corn directly in the garden soil (versus indoors) so that their sensitive roots aren’t disturbed when&nbsp;transplanting.</li><li>Corn is very sensitive to frost; do not plant&nbsp;soil temperature is at least 60°F (16°C), or&nbsp;65°F (18°C) for supersweet varieties. Usually, this is 2 or 3 weeks after the last frost in spring. See our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/planting-calendar\">Planting Calendar</a>&nbsp;for corn based on average frost dates.<ul><li>If you live in an area with a shorter growing season, choose an early variety that will mature well before the first fall frost. The&nbsp;ground can be warmed by a black plastic cover; sow seeds through holes in the&nbsp;plastic.</li></ul></li><li>A couple of weeks after planting your first round of corn, plant another round in order to extend the&nbsp;harvest.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/corn-garden_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"Corn in the garden\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"></p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Corn</h3><ul><li>To speed germination, moisten seeds, wrap them in moist paper towels, and store them in a plastic bag for 24&nbsp;hours.</li><li>Because corn is wind-pollinated, it’s essential to plant in a block, rather than a single row. For decent pollination, we recommend a modest block of, say, 10 to 50 plants. This maximizes the chances of the pollen released from the male tassels at the top of the plants drifting down into contact with the female silks lower down. Incomplete or inconsistent kernel development, with the cobs only partly or sporadically filled, is down to poor pollination. The silks protruding from the end of each cob are responsible for carrying the pollen down to the kernels. One strand connects to one kernel, so for complete fill, every strand of the silk must be&nbsp;pollinated.</li><li>Sow seeds about 1½ to 2&nbsp;inches deep and 12 inches apart in rows 2½ to 3 feet apart. Don’t plant too close together or you run the risk of disappointingly small&nbsp;cobs.</li><li>You may choose to fertilize at planting time with a general purpose (10-10-10 fertilizer);&nbsp;corn is meant to grow&nbsp;rapidly.</li><li>Water well at planting&nbsp;time.</li></ul><h3>Sowing Corn&nbsp;Indoors</h3><p>If you’re going to start seeds early, sow the seeds in pots&nbsp;under the protection of a greenhouse, hoop house, or cold frame. This means you can begin sowing three to four weeks before your last frost date, giving you a head start on corn sown outdoors—a huge advantage for areas with shorter growing&nbsp;seasons.</p><p>Sow eight to ten seeds 1/2 inch deep into 4-inch-wide pots, or sow two seeds per module in a plug tray and remove the weakest of the two seedlings when they emerge. Keep the potting soil moist as they grow&nbsp;on.</p><p>Harden off the plants as your recommended planting time approaches by placing them outside for increasingly longer spells over the course of about a week. Plants should be at least 6 inches tall by the time they’re transplanted&nbsp;outdoors.</p><p>Check out this video for great tips on growing juicy&nbsp;corn:</p><p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ts--iMD4YcA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Consistent moisture will encourage bigger, fatter ears of corn, so it’s hard to over-emphasize the importance of this. Keep corn well watered, as it has shallow roots and can become stressed by drought. About 2 inches of water per week is sufficient; water more if conditions are especially hot or if your soil is sandy. If the soil remains dry, soak the soil again. When watering, aim at the base of plants to avoid problems with fungal&nbsp;diseases.</li><li>Mulch helps to reduce evaporation around the&nbsp;plants.</li><li>Corn’s roots are shallow and can easily be damaged by hoeing. Instead, weed your corn by hand for as long as you’re still able to get between the plants without damaging them.&nbsp; Then, apply several inches of&nbsp;mulch.</li><li>Corn sometimes produces aerial roots a few inches above the soil. These are not meant to absorb water or nutrients but rather to stabilize the tall stalk. If this happens, mound soil up over the roots to keep them covered, or just cover the whole area with a mulch of compost, which will help feed the plants,&nbsp;too.</li><li>Support stalks in windy places. Mounding the soil around the base of 12-inch-tall plants will help. If you do notice plants getting rocked about in the wind, consider tying them to&nbsp;stakes.</li><li>Wind pollination is critical to developing full cobs of kernels. To help this along,&nbsp;gently shake the&nbsp;stalks of the plants every few days for as long as the tassels are viable to increase the chances of every silk being pollinated.&nbsp; Mornings are best. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/best-way-pollinate-corn-plump-full-ears\">Learn more about corn pollination, including how to hand-pollinate to guarantee pollination success</a>.</li><li>Watch for signs of nitrogen deficiency (yellowing leaves) and respond with quick side-dressings of a nitrogen-rich fertilizer such as fish&nbsp;emulsion.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Tillers, or “suckers,” are secondary shoots that may develop low on the stalk later in the season.

Each one contains a different level of sucrose, changing the flavor and texture of the corn. The type of corn will be listed right on the seed&nbsp;packet.</p><p>It’s important to be aware of which type of corn you’re growing—not only because of the sugar content, but also due to how easily the types can cross-pollinate. If&nbsp;the wrong combination of types cross-pollinates, the ears that are produced may be of subpar&nbsp;quality.</p><ul><li><strong>Sugary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(su)</strong> sweet corn is the classic sweet corn. Sugary varieties grow&nbsp;vigorously and are stress resistant.&nbsp;The kernels aren’t too sweet and are said to have a “traditional” taste. However, the sugars in sugary sweet corn quickly turn to starch after the ears are picked, so they need to&nbsp;be eaten right after picking. Do not plant near shrunken or synergistic&nbsp;types.</li><li><strong>Sugar-enhanced&nbsp;(se)</strong> sweet corn is slightly sweeter than sugary varieties. They keep their sweetness&nbsp;for a longer period of time after harvest (a few days) than sugary varieties. They grow well with few issues. Do not plant near shrunken&nbsp;types.</li><li><strong>Shrunken</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(sh, sh2)</strong> sweet corn—also called “supersweet”—are the sweetest varieties, containing two to three times more sugar than sugary varieties. The sugar in their kernels lasts even longer after harvest (up to a week) than the other types, but kernels tend to be more crunchy and not taste as “corny.” Shrunken types are also more finicky overall. Do not plant them near any other types; hybrid kernels turn out starchy and&nbsp;tough.</li><li><strong>Synergistic (sy)</strong> sweet corn combines sugar-enhanced with one of the other two types to create varieties that have the best of both worlds. Synergistic types tend to have very sweet, tender kernels with a good taste and some synergistic varieties can keep up to a week after harvest. Do not plant near sugary or shrunken&nbsp;types.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Recommended varieties&nbsp;include:</p><ul><li><strong>‘Argent’</strong>: sugar-enhanced variety, good taste. White&nbsp;kernels.</li><li><strong>‘Iochief’</strong>: midseason, normal-sugar variety. Yellow&nbsp;kernels.</li><li><strong>‘Luther Hill’</strong>: dwarf, normal-sugar variety. Produces 4- to 6-inch ears on 4- to 5-foot stalks. White kernels. Grow at least nine dwarf plants in a block of three or four&nbsp;rows.</li><li><strong>‘Silver Queen’</strong>: normal-sugar variety. Resistant to some bacterial diseases. White&nbsp;kernels.</li><li><strong>‘Sweet Sunshine’</strong>: supersweet variety. Disease resistant and high yield.

If it’s white, or milky, it’s ready. The milk stage is brief; in hot weather (over 85°F/29°C), sweet corn is at peak for only 1 to 2 days, so check it frequently.

My question is, at this point if the issue was nutrients, is there enough time for ears to develop before the tassels are no good?

And if your corn looks tall and green but lacks ears, it might be overcrowded, and your plantings are too thick. However, the yellowing that you mention, plus the lack of ears, does indeed suggest nitrogen deficiency. It's hard for us to diagnose from afar, and you should call your local county extension services. In terms of a solution, there are mixed results on late-season nitrogen application for corn. If your corn already had a nice nitrogen application in fall/spring, and it's the weather called some leaching, it may work. If the corn lacked nitrogen all along, it probably wouldn't make up the yield. But you might as well try it.

This is our first year having grown popping corn which was going really great till some very adorable squirrels got into it and after trying a bunch of different ways to keeps them out of the corn we finally decided to pull the fully ready ones (not dried) and are hoping it’s possible to dry them inside but is it possible? The rest we left with cages over the ears of corn. Not mad at the squirrels bc it’s just nature but hoping we will still be able to have something to show for it.

There are a number of pests that will use what remains after harvest as a winter home and by removing the stalks you will greatly reduce their chances of survival. But you have a few options of what to do with your stalks.</p><p>You can cut them down and put them in your compost pile. We suggest cutting them up some to increase the rate of decomposition. You will then want to till the stalk nubs back into the soil. You can also till all of it into the soil. There are a lot of great nutrients that remain in corn stalks and it will provide good organic matter for next year's plantings once it breaks down.</p><p>And if you want to think ahead, cut some of the stalks and dry them upside down and they will make for great decor when fall rolls around!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-130758\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"129670\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Louise Mcintosh&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 05/27/2023 - 22:59</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"129670\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90286\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      Could you please post how you boil corn and how you barbeque it.

When you boil corn on the cob, allow the water to come to a full boil and then add in the ears of corn. Cook it for 5 minutes. When it comes to cooking corn on the cob on the grill there are several methods. Try this: peel the corn and remove the silk. Pull the husks back up and then soak the ears in salted water for about 10 minutes. Remove and make sure to shake off any excess water. Place the ears on the grill, close the lid, and turn every 6 minutes. Your corn should be ready after 20 minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-129710\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div
