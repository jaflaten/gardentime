  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting\nRaspberries grow best in a sunny location, but unlike many fruits, they will also grow successfully in a partially shaded spot. However, the more sun, the more fruit! The planting site should have rich and well-draining soil, great air circulation, and shelter from the wind. Avoid a wet and windy area, as raspberries do not like to stand in water or totally dry out. Every year, feed your raspberry plants with a couple of inches of compost or aged manure; dig it into the soil a couple of weeks before planting (A good rate is about 3 1/2 cubic feet of compost per 100 square feet). Plant your berries far from wild-growing berries. Otherwise, you risk spreading wild pests and diseases to your cultivated berry plants. When to Plant Raspberries Start with one-year-old raspberry canes from a reputable nursery. Plant the early spring once the ground thaws out and can be worked (See your local frost dates). In mild areas, you could also plant in late autumn to give the plants a head start. Plant potted transplants in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. How to Plant Raspberries Before planting, soak the roots for an hour or two. Dig a hole that is roomy enough for the roots to spread. If you’re planting multiple bushes, it’s easiest to dig a trench. Whether you’re planting bare-root or potted plants, keep the crown of the plant 1 or 2 inches above the ground. Canes should be spaced 18 inches apart, with about 4 feet between rows. Fill the soil back in, and tamp it down with your foot. Once the canes are planted, cut them down to 9 inches tall to encourage new growth. (Yes, it will look like a broken branch sticking out of the ground!) Depending on your plant variety, you may need to fashion a support to hold up canes. Many grow to head height. A trellis or a fence are good options. If you have a row, drive in two 6-foot posts at the end of the row and stretch galvanized wire between the posts. Summer-fruiting raspberries need three horizontal wires, and the fall types could do with two wires.

  "careInstructions" : "### From Backyard to Berry Bowl: Your Complete Raspberry-Growing Guide\n\n\n### Growing\nMulching is important throughout the season to conserve moisture and suffocate weeds. Keep a thick layer of mulch surrounding plants at all times. Water 1 inch per week from spring until after harvest. Regular watering is better than infrequent deep soaking. Keep your raspberry bushes tidy by digging up any “suckers” or canes that grow well away from the rows; if you don’t dig them up, they’ll draw nutrients away, and you’ll have fewer berries next year. If you wish, you can replant the suckers, and you’ll have new plants! Dig them up, set them in a fresh area of prepared ground, and water them after planting. How to Prune Raspberries Prune summer-fruiting raspberries immediately after you’re done picking! Cut only the canes that produced berries back down to the ground. (Remember, this plant produces berries on two-year-old canes while one-year-old canes grow right beside them. You shouldn’t have trouble telling which is which: the older canes have brown stems, and the young ones are still green. Prune only the older ones, the ones that have finished their fruitful year.) Tie the remaining canes to the supporting wires with garden string. There should not be any more than one cane every four inches of wire, so cut down additional canes. Ever-bearing or fall-bearing raspberries This is easy. Just cut all canes back to the ground in late winter before growth begins in the spring. They give fruit on canes that are in their first year of growth, after which there is no reason to keep them. Mow them to the ground or use pruning shears for a small patch. Clean up all debris—diseases and pests overwinter. Pruning is only required during the growing season if you want to keep a uniform order. Dig or pull up new canes that grow well away from the rows. If your raspberry canes are disease-free you can transplant them to raise more plants. Note: The above assumes you are harvesting a fall crop. To get both fall and following summer crop, do not remove the primocanes that produced the fall crop. Prune them back in spring to about 12 inches above the support, or to the last visible node that had fruit, cutting off the dead tips.\n\n### How to Grow Plums: Planting, Care, and Harvesting Tips for Juicy Fruit\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Harvesting\nAll varieties will begin to produce fruit in their second season. In some cases, ever-bearers may bear small berries in their first autumn. In early summer, berries will ripen over about 2 weeks. You will need to pick berries every couple of days! Try to harvest berries on a sunny day when they are dry. Gently pull raspberries away from their central plug once they’re richly colored all over. They should come away easily. Don’t tug too hard on your raspberries when picking. A ripe raspberry will leave the vine willingly. How to Store Raspberries Raspberries won’t keep for long, so enjoy them soon after picking them! They can be kept refrigerated for about five days. Don’t wash the berries after picking unless you’re going to eat them straight away. They will grow moldy and mushy if not kept dry in storage. If you do need to wash them, let them air dry completely before storing them. Raspberries can be frozen! As with freezing blueberries, make a single layer of berries on a cookie sheet. When frozen, place into airtight bags. Use on waffles, in cereal, or whenever you need a refreshing, healthy snack!\n\n### How to Grow Plums: Planting, Care, and Harvesting Tips for Juicy Fruit\n",
  "pestsAndDiseases" : "### Pests/Diseases\nRaspberries are one of the few fruits that are hardly bothered by pests and diseases. (Black raspberries are more susceptible to this type of damage than red or purple.) Keep an eye out for spider mites and Japanese beetles from June through August. Raspberries are a favorite of Japanese beetles in particular. Rabbits love to eat the canes in winter. A chicken wire fence will help prevent rabbit damage. Powdery Mildew Cane Borers",

Meet the raspberry—nature’s candy and a home gardener’s dream! These berry bushes don’t ask for much, but boy, do they give back. With just one plant, you can harvest hundreds of berries each season—perfect for snacking, baking, jamming, or tossing in your smoothies. Whether you’re team summer-bearing or all about the fall fruit, we’ve got everything you need to know to plant, grow, and prune your way to raspberry&nbsp;heaven.</p><h2>About&nbsp;Raspberries</h2><p>Raspberries are shrubs belonging to the Rosaceae family in the genus <em>Rubus</em>.&nbsp;Not only are raspberries perfect for picking and eating straight off the stem, but they&#8217;re also wonderful in jams, pies and tarts, or smoothies and drinks. Plus, fresh raspberries are an excellent source of vitamin C to support&nbsp;the immune system and help fight&nbsp;infections.</p><p>There are two types of raspberries, both with their own specific requirements for growing:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Summer-fruiting raspberries are more common. </strong>They develop their fruit on last year&#8217;s growth and bear one crop per season in summertime (often June or&nbsp;July).</li><li><strong>Ever-bearing&nbsp;raspberries</strong>&nbsp;(also called <strong>fall-bearing</strong> or <strong>autumn-bearing</strong>)&nbsp;produce berries on new canes. They bear a fall crop and can also&nbsp;produce fruit the following&nbsp;summer.</li></ol><p>A mix of both types of berries would be an ideal way to maximize the harvest&nbsp;period.</p><p>All raspberries are self-fertile, so you only need one bush to produce fruit. They&#8217;re best pollinated by bees and will start producing fruit a year after&nbsp;planting.</p><p>Though raspberry bushes are naturally inclined to&nbsp;grow in cooler climates, the plants&nbsp;now come in many&nbsp;varieties suited to a range of <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/plant-hardiness-zones\">planting zones</a>.</p><h3>The Importance of Pruning&nbsp;Raspberries</h3><p>All raspberries will need pruning annually!&nbsp;Raspberries are perennials. However, it&#8217;s important to realize that the branches (or canes) that bear the fruit live for only 2 summers. During the first year, the new green cane (<strong>primocane</strong>) grows vegetatively. The cane develops a brown bark, is dormant in winter, and during the second growing season is called a <strong>floricane</strong>. It produces fruit in early to mid-summer and then dies. New primocanes are produced each year, so fruit production continues year after year. It&#8217;s your job to prune out those dead canes each&nbsp;year.</p><p>See more pruning advice&nbsp;below.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-89fb95d0723be0e85cacd6b4ea8953f17d7ba84ed011a407caa945ba00caa757\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/video/how-grow-berries-easy-beginners\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Berries: Easy for Beginners</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/plums\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Plums: Planting, Care, and Harvesting Tips for Juicy Fruit</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/blueberries-easiest-fruit-grow-also-one-healthiest\" hreflang=\"und\">Blueberries: The Easiest Fruit to Grow Is Also One of the Healthiest</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        <p>Raspberries grow best in a sunny location, but unlike many fruits, they will also grow successfully in a partially shaded spot. However, the more sun, the more&nbsp;fruit!</p><p>The planting&nbsp;site should have rich and&nbsp;well-draining soil,&nbsp;great air circulation, and shelter from the wind.&nbsp;Avoid a wet and windy area, as raspberries do not like to stand in water or totally dry&nbsp;out.</p><p>Every year, feed your raspberry plants with a&nbsp;couple of inches of compost or aged manure; dig it into the soil a couple of weeks before planting (A good rate is about 3 1/2 cubic feet of compost per 100 square&nbsp;feet).</p><p>Plant your berries far from wild-growing berries. Otherwise, you risk spreading wild&nbsp;pests and diseases to your cultivated berry&nbsp;plants.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Raspberries</h3><ul><li>Start with one-year-old raspberry canes from a reputable&nbsp;nursery. Plant&nbsp;the early spring once the ground thaws out and can be worked&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">See your local frost dates</a>).</li><li>In mild areas, you could also plant in late autumn to give the plants a head&nbsp;start.</li><li>Plant potted transplants in the spring after the threat of frost has&nbsp;passed.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/AlmanacStaffArchive/raspberries-on-branch_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"Raspberries on branch\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\" loading=\"lazy\"></p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Raspberries</h3><ul><li>Before planting, soak the roots for an hour or&nbsp;two.</li><li>Dig a hole that is roomy enough for the roots to spread. If you’re planting multiple bushes, it’s easiest to dig a&nbsp;trench.</li><li>Whether you’re planting bare-root or potted plants, keep the crown of the plant 1 or 2 inches above the&nbsp;ground.</li><li>Canes should be spaced 18 inches apart, with about 4 feet between&nbsp;rows.</li><li>Fill the soil back in, and tamp it down with your&nbsp;foot.</li><li>Once the canes are planted, cut them down to 9 inches tall to encourage new growth. (Yes, it will look like a broken branch sticking out of the&nbsp;ground!)</li><li>Depending on your plant variety, you may need to fashion a support to hold up canes. Many grow to head&nbsp;height.</li><li>A trellis or a fence are good options. If you have a row, drive in two 6-foot posts at the end of the row and stretch galvanized wire between the posts. Summer-fruiting raspberries need three horizontal wires, and the fall types could do with two&nbsp;wires.</li></ul><p>Check out this video to learn how to plant&nbsp;raspberries.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"youtube-container\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzOLUf7ibek\" width=\"720\"></iframe></div></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/blog/gardening/garden-journal/mulching-guide-benefits-and-downsides-mulch\">Mulching</a> is important throughout the season to conserve moisture and suffocate weeds. Keep a thick layer of mulch surrounding plants at all&nbsp;times.</li><li>Water 1 inch per week&nbsp;from spring until after harvest. Regular watering is better than infrequent deep&nbsp;soaking.</li><li>Keep your raspberry bushes tidy by digging up any “suckers” or canes that grow well away from the rows; if you don’t dig them up, they’ll draw nutrients away, and you’ll have fewer berries next&nbsp;year.</li><li>If you wish, you can replant the suckers, and you’ll have new plants!&nbsp; Dig them up, set them in a fresh area of prepared ground, and water them after&nbsp;planting.</li></ul><h3>How to Prune&nbsp;Raspberries</h3><p>Prune summer-fruiting raspberries immediately after you’re done picking! Cut only the canes that produced berries back down to the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>(Remember, this plant produces&nbsp;berries on two-year-old canes while one-year-old canes grow right beside them. You shouldn’t have trouble telling which is which: the older canes have brown stems, and the young ones are still green. Prune only the older ones, the ones that have finished their fruitful&nbsp;year.)</p><p>Tie the remaining canes to the supporting wires with garden string.&nbsp;There should not be any more than one cane every four inches of wire, so cut down additional&nbsp;canes.</p><h3>Ever-bearing&nbsp;or&nbsp;fall-bearing&nbsp;raspberries&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>This is easy. Just&nbsp;cut all canes back to the ground in late winter before growth begins in the spring.&nbsp;They give fruit on canes that are in their first year of growth, after which there is no reason to keep them.&nbsp;Mow them to the ground or use pruning shears for a small&nbsp;patch.</li><li>Clean up all debris—diseases and pests&nbsp;overwinter.</li><li>Pruning is only required during the growing season if you want to keep a uniform order. Dig or pull up new canes that grow well away from the rows. If your raspberry canes are disease-free you can transplant them to raise more&nbsp;plants.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The above&nbsp;assumes you are harvesting a fall crop.&nbsp;To get&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;fall and following summer crop, do not remove the&nbsp;primocanes that produced the fall crop. Prune them back in spring to about 12 inches above the support, or to the last visible node that had fruit, cutting off the dead&nbsp;tips.</p><p><a href=\"https://gardenplanner.almanac.com/\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/Almanac%20Staff/growveg_raspberries.jpeg\" alt=\"Spacing for Raspberries\" width=\"720\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n        <p>There are many, many raspberry varieties available today—and each one is unique!

When frozen, place into airtight bags.

So, it depends on if you want your everbearing raspberry bushes to produce two crops each year (summer and fall) or just one (fall). In order to get that smaller summer crop next year before the bountiful one in the fall, the fruit will grow on the bottom of this year's canes. If that is the case, leave this year's growth to see what raspberries will appear early in next year's growing season. You can then prune those canes out after harvest. If you just want a single fall crop next fall, the fruit will grow on next year's cane growth, so you can prune out this year's canes between fall and late winter. Hope this helps!</p>\r\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-126117\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n
