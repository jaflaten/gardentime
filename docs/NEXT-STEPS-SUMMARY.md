## 🎯 The Core Feature: Season Planning

### Why This Matters
Many crops (tomatoes, peppers, eggplants) need to be **started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost**. Gardeners struggle with knowing when to start seeds.

### What We're Building
A system that:
1. Stores user's frost dates (one-time setup)
2. Calculates optimal planting dates automatically
3. Shows upcoming tasks ("Start tomato seeds in 3 days")
4. Creates crop records when user transplants to garden
5. Displays everything on visual calendar

### Example Workflow
```
1. User creates "Spring 2025" season plan
2. User adds "Tomato" to plan
3. System calculates:
   - Start seeds indoors: March 27
   - Transplant outdoors: May 22
   - Expected harvest: August 5
4. Dashboard shows: "Start tomato seeds (in 3 days)"
5. User marks as "Seeds Started"
6. Later: User marks as "Transplanted" → Creates crop record
7. Tomato appears on garden board automatically!
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing (MVP)
Focus on these scenarios:
1. Create season plan with frost dates
2. Add 5 different plants to plan
3. Verify dates are calculated correctly
4. Mark crop as "Seeds Started"
5. Mark crop as "Transplanted" → verify crop record created
6. Check crop appears on garden board
7. View calendar with all events
8. Test on mobile

### Automated Testing (Later)
- Unit tests for PlantingDateCalculator
- API endpoint tests
- E2E tests for complete workflow

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Start Small
Build minimal working version first:
- Basic dashboard with 3 widgets
- Simple season plan creation
- Basic date calculations
- Minimal calendar view

Then enhance with:
- More widgets
- Advanced calendar features
- Notifications
- Analytics

### Use Placeholder Data
The 20 plants in placeholder-plant-data.sql are enough to:
- Test all features
- Demo to users
- Validate calculations
- Build UI

Later, enhance with plant-data-aggregator API.

### Focus on User Value
Most important features in order:
1. ✅ Dashboard showing upcoming tasks
2. ✅ Season plan with date calculations
3. ✅ Integration with crop records
4. Calendar view
5. Multiple seasons/phases
6. Analytics and stats

### Mobile First
Many gardeners will use this in the garden on their phone. Design for mobile from the start.

## 📈 Success Metrics

After implementation, track:
- % of users who create season plans
- % of planned crops that become crop records
- Time from sign-up to first season plan
- User feedback on date accuracy

---

## 🎉 What This Unlocks

Once Season Planning is implemented, we can build:
- Succession planting suggestions
- Crop rotation recommendations
- Weather-based adjustments
- Community season plan templates
- Harvest forecasting
- Seed inventory tracking

This is the **foundation feature** that makes GardenTime truly powerful!

---

## 📞 Questions or Issues?

All questions from earlier have been answered and documented. If new questions arise during implementation:

1. Check relevant docs first:
   - dashboard-quick-start.md for how-to
   - season-planning-explained.md for why/what
   - garden-management-dashboard-spec.md for details

2. Document decisions in changelog.md

3. Update TODO items as you complete them

---

## ✨ Final Notes

This feature set (Steps 64-69) is **fully specified and ready to implement**. All database schemas, API endpoints, UI components, and business logic have been designed. The placeholder data is ready. The implementation guide is complete.

**Estimated time:** 2-3 weeks for full implementation (dashboard + season planning)

**Recommended approach:** Start with dashboard (Days 1-5), get quick wins, then move to season planning (Days 6-15).

**You've got this!** The planning is done. Time to build something amazing! 🌱🚀
