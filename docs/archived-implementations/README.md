These files document the implementation process and decisions made during development, but are archived to keep the main docs folder focused on current specifications and guides.

## Contents

- Step implementation files (step-*.md)
- Feature implementation summaries
- Migration and refactoring guides
- Quick start guides for completed features

For current project status and next steps, see the main docs folder.
