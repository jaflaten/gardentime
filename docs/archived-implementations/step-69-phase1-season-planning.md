# Step 69: Season Planning & Planting Calendar - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Basic functionality implemented  
**Next:** Phase 2 - Advanced features (calendar view, widgets, integrations)

---

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Already Complete)
The backend implementation was already finished before this session:

1. **Database Migrations (V7, V8):**
   - `garden_climate_info` table - Store frost dates and hardiness zones
   - `season_plans` table - Track seasonal growing plans
   - `planned_crops` table - Individual crop plans with dates
   - `plant_details` table - Indoor starting requirements for plants

2. **Kotlin Entities:**
   - `GardenClimateInfo` - Climate data model
   - `SeasonPlan` - Season plan model
   - `PlannedCrop` - Planned crop model with all date fields

3. **Repositories:**
   - `GardenClimateInfoRepository`
   - `SeasonPlanRepository`
   - `PlannedCropRepository`

4. **Service Layer:**
   - `SeasonPlanningService` - Business logic including date calculations

5. **API Controller:**
   - `SeasonPlanningController` - Complete REST API with all endpoints

### Frontend (Newly Implemented)

#### 1. BFF API Routes (Next.js)
Created TypeScript proxy routes to connect frontend to Spring Boot backend:

- **`/api/gardens/[gardenId]/climate/route.ts`**
  - GET - Fetch climate info
  - PUT - Update climate info (frost dates, hardiness zone)

- **`/api/gardens/[gardenId]/season-plans/route.ts`**
  - GET - List all season plans
  - POST - Create new season plan

- **`/api/gardens/[gardenId]/season-plans/[seasonPlanId]/planned-crops/route.ts`**
  - GET - List planned crops (with status filter)
  - POST - Add crop to plan

- **`/api/gardens/[gardenId]/season-plans/[seasonPlanId]/planned-crops/[plannedCropId]/route.ts`**
  - PATCH - Update planned crop (status, dates, notes)
  - DELETE - Remove planned crop from plan

- **`/api/gardens/[gardenId]/calendar/route.ts`**
  - GET - Fetch calendar events for date range

#### 2. TypeScript Types
Created `/types/season-planning.ts` with:
- `GardenClimateInfo` - Climate data interface
- `SeasonPlan` - Season plan interface
- `PlannedCrop` - Planned crop with all fields
- `CalendarEvent` - Calendar event interface
- `CalendarResponse` - Calendar API response

#### 3. Season Planning Page
Created `/app/gardens/[id]/season-plan/page.tsx`:

**Features:**
- List season plans for garden
- Display current/active season plan
- Show planned crops with status and dates
- Climate info setup modal
- Create new season plan modal
- Quick navigation buttons

**User Flow:**
1. Navigate to garden â†’ Season Plan tab
2. If no climate info â†’ Modal prompts for frost dates
3. If no season plan â†’ Button to create first plan
4. Once created â†’ Shows planned crops list
5. Can add crops (button visible, functionality coming in Phase 2)

**UI Elements:**
- Climate info banner showing frost dates
- Season header with season/year and crop count
- Planned crops list with:
  - Plant name and quantity
  - Status badge
  - Color-coded date indicators (ðŸ”µðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡)
  - Edit/Remove buttons (placeholders for Phase 2)
- Quick action cards for navigation

#### 4. Navigation Updates
Updated `GardenNavigation.tsx`:
- Added "Season Plan" tab between Dashboard and Grow Areas
- Uses Calendar icon from lucide-react
- Consistent styling with other nav items

## Data Flow

### Creating a Season Plan
1. User clicks "Create Season Plan"
2. Frontend: POST to `/api/gardens/{gardenId}/season-plans`
3. Backend: Creates `SeasonPlan` entity
4. Frontend: Refreshes data, shows empty plan

### Setting Up Climate Info
1. User enters frost dates in modal
2. Frontend: PUT to `/api/gardens/{gardenId}/climate`
3. Backend: Saves to `garden_climate_info` table
4. Frontend: Updates state, closes modal

### Adding a Planned Crop (Phase 2)
1. User selects plant from search
2. Backend: Calculates dates based on plant's `weeks_before_frost_indoor`
3. Frontend: Displays calculated dates (indoor start, transplant, harvest)
4. User confirms
5. Frontend: POST to planned-crops endpoint
6. Backend: Saves `PlannedCrop` with all dates
7. Frontend: Adds to list

## Phase 2 - Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Add Planned Crop Modal (69.10)**
   - Plant search/autocomplete
   - Grow area selector
   - Display calculated dates from backend
   - Manual date override option
   - Phase selector (Early/Mid/Late)

2. **Edit/Delete Planned Crops**
   - Wire up Edit button â†’ Open modal with prefilled data
   - Wire up Remove button â†’ DELETE request + refresh
   - Status update buttons (Seeds Started, Transplanted, etc.)

3. **Season Plan Dashboard Widget (69.13)**
   - Add widget to main dashboard page
   - Show upcoming seed starting tasks
   - Progress bar for season
   - Link to full season plan

### Medium Priority
4. **Full Calendar View (69.12)**
   - New route `/gardens/[id]/calendar`
   - Monthly grid layout
   - Fetch events from calendar API
   - Color-code by event type
   - Click event â†’ Show details modal

5. **Indoor Seed Starting Alerts (69.14)**
   - Widget showing upcoming dates
   - Alert badges (this week, overdue, etc.)
   - Filter by timeframe

### Lower Priority
6. **Integration with Crop Records (69.15)**
   - Button on planned crop: "Plant Now"
   - Opens crop record creation modal
   - Pre-fills data from planned crop
   - Creates crop_record
   - Links crop_record_id back to planned_crop
   - Updates status automatically

7. **Load Placeholder Plant Data**
   - Execute `/docs/placeholder-plant-data.sql`
   - Populate `plant_details` for 20 common plants
   - Enables date calculation testing

## Technical Decisions

### Why BFF Pattern?
All API calls flow through Next.js BFF routes before reaching Spring Boot. This provides:
- Centralized authentication handling
- Consistent error handling
- TypeScript type safety
- Easier frontend mocking/testing

### Why Separate Tables?
- `season_plans` - Groups planned crops by season/year
- `planned_crops` - Individual crop plans (many-to-one with season_plans)
- `garden_climate_info` - Garden-specific climate data (one-to-one with gardens)
- `plant_details` - Plant-specific growing info (one-to-one with plants)

This normalization allows:
- Multiple seasons per garden
- Reusable plant data across gardens
- Historical tracking of season plans

### Date Calculation Logic
Backend service calculates dates based on:
```kotlin
indoorStartDate = lastFrostDate - plant.weeksBeforeFrost
transplantDate = lastFrostDate + safetyBuffer (1-2 weeks)
expectedHarvestDate = transplantDate + plant.daysToMaturity
```

Frontend displays these dates but allows manual override.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Plant Data Yet**
   - Plant search will work but dates won't calculate
   - Need to load `/docs/placeholder-plant-data.sql`

2. **No Date Calculations Displayed**
   - Backend calculates dates when creating planned crops
   - Frontend needs modal to show these calculations
   - Coming in Phase 2

3. **No Status Updates**
   - Can't mark crops as "Seeds Started" yet
   - Need status update buttons + PATCH request
   - Coming in Phase 2

4. **No Calendar View**
   - Calendar API exists but no UI yet
   - Coming in Phase 2

### Future Enhancements
- Auto-detect hardiness zone from ZIP/postal code
- Weather API integration for frost warnings
- Email/push notifications for seed starting
- Succession planting suggestions
- Crop rotation integration
- Export season plan to PDF/CSV

## Documentation References

- **Detailed Spec:** `/docs/garden-management-dashboard-spec.md` (Step 69)
- **Implementation Plan:** `/docs/dashboard-implementation-plan.md` (Phase 2)
- **Season Planning Explained:** `/docs/season-planning-explained.md`
- **Placeholder Data:** `/docs/placeholder-plant-data.sql` (20 plants)
- **TODO:** `/docs/todo.md` (Step 69 section)

## Conclusion

Step 69 Phase 1 is complete with a solid foundation:
- Full backend implementation
- BFF API routes
- Basic season planning page
- Navigation integration

The user can now:
- Set up frost dates for their garden
- Create season plans
- View planned crops (once added via Phase 2)

Phase 2 will add the critical "add crop" functionality and make the feature fully usable with date calculations, calendar views, and dashboard integration.
