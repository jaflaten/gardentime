# Plant Recommendations, Geo-Location & Temperature — Feature Proposal

This document proposes a focused extension to GardenTime: richer plant metadata, geo-location and temperature-aware recommendations, and regenerative-friendly rotation/companion rules that power a "What to plant next" feature.

It is written as a reviewable spec: goals, data model, API surface, recommendation algorithm, UI flows, edge cases, tests, and an MVP implementation plan.

Goals
- Improve recommendation relevance by using garden geo-location and local temperature/seasonality.
- Support regenerative principles (crop rotation, diversity, nitrogen management) and companion planting.
- Keep the system incremental and safe: additive data model changes and opt-in features.

Assumptions
- GardenTime already has models for Garden, GrowArea, Plant, and CropRecord (history of plantings).
- Users can optionally provide garden geo-location (lat/lon) and climate preference (or we can infer from location).
- Plant metadata and CropRecord history are available and can be extended.

Why geo-location & temperature matter
- Hardiness, sow/plant windows, and what will reliably mature depend heavily on local climate and average temperatures.
- Night-time lows, first/last frost dates, and heat waves affect planting dates and crop suitability.
- Geo data enables connecting to weather, hardiness zone lookups, and temperature-driven growing-degree-day (GDD) calculations.

High-level feature list (prioritized)
1. Garden geo-location + climate settings (required input for localized recommendations)
2. Plant metadata extensions to include climate/temperature windows and GDD thresholds
3. Recommendation engine that uses: rotation rules, companion data, sun/water/soil fit, and geo/temperature seasonality
4. UI: "What to plant next" with explanations; overlays on the board showing conflicts and best placements
5. Optional integrations: frost/zone lookup, simple weather API for recent temps and GDD

Data model changes (additive)
- Garden
  - latitude: number | null
  - longitude: number | null
  - timeZone: string | null (optional, for calendar/scheduling)
  - preferredHardinessZone: string | null (optional override)
  - rotationPolicy: {maxConsecutiveSameFamily: number, preferNitrogenFixersAfterHeavyFeeders: boolean}

- Plant (extend existing Plant table/entity)
  - botanicalName: string? (optional)
  - family: string? (e.g., Brassicaceae, Solanaceae)
  - plantType: enum (annual|perennial|biennial|cover)
  - nitrogenFixing: boolean
  - nutrientProfile: json {nitrogen: low|medium|high, phosphorus: low|...}
  - sunExposure: enum (full|partial|shade)
  - waterNeeds: enum (low|medium|high) or mm/week range
  - soilPHRange: {min: number, max: number} | null
  - growingTempRangeC: {min: number, max: number} | null  // expected daytime growth temps
  - frostTolerance: enum (verySensitive|sensitive|tolerant|veryTolerant)
  - gddBase: number? // base temperature for GDD calculations (optional)
  - gddRequirement: number? // cumulative GDD to maturity (optional)
  - plantingWindowByZone: json (optional) // precomputed month ranges per hardiness zone or climate category
  - companionLikes: string[] (families or plant slugs)
  - companionDislikes: string[]
  - pestsDiseases: string[]
  - rotationCooldownSeasons: number (how many seasons to avoid same family) — default 1–2

- CropRecord (history)
  - ...existing fields...
  - recordedPlantFamily: string (denormalized for quick rotation checks)

Recommendation API surface
- GET /api/gardens/:gardenId/recommendations?growAreaId=&k=5&season=auto
  - Inputs: gardenId, optional growAreaId, desired date/season (or auto-infer from now + location), constraints (sun, size), user preferences (exclude/include lists)
  - Output: List of plant suggestions ranked by score. Each entry contains: plantId, score, scoreBreakdown (rotationPenalty, seasonalFit, companionScore, nutrientScore, pestRisk), recommendedAction (sow/transplant), recommendedDateRange, reasonSummary

- POST /api/gardens/:gardenId/rotation-policy
  - body: {maxConsecutiveSameFamily: number, preferNitrogenFixersAfterHeavyFeeders: boolean}

- GET /api/plants/:id (include extended metadata)
- POST /api/plants (admin/curation)

Recommendation scoring (starter deterministic algorithm)
Inputs used:
- Garden geo (lat/lon) → infer hardiness zone and local seasonality
- Recent weather (optional) or historical averages
- CropRecord history for the grow area and garden (last N seasons)
- Plant metadata (family, gddRequirement, tempRange, plantingWindow)
- Neighboring grow areas' current/active crops for companion scoring

Score components (weights are configurable):
- Rotation penalty (negative)
  - If same family appears in the last X seasons, apply penalty proportional to consecutive count and rotationCooldownSeasons
- Seasonal/temperature fit (positive/negative)
  - Check if current/target date is within plantingWindow or if cumulative GDD to maturity is achievable before expected frost/heat
- Sun/water/soil fit (positive/negative)
  - Match GrowArea properties (if available) against plant needs
- Companion score (positive/negative)
  - Sum pairwise preferences with neighboring plants
- Nutrient strategy (positive)
  - Reward nitrogen-fixers if recent history shows heavy feeders
- Pest risk (negative)
  - Penalize if repeating crops susceptible to the same pest/disease
- Diversity bonus (positive)
  - Slight boost for under-used families to encourage regenerative diversity

Output should be explainable: include human-readable reasons and numeric breakdown so users can understand recommendations.

Geo & temperature specifics
- Hardiness Zone and Frost Dates
  - Use garden lat/lon to look up USDA/WWF hardiness zone or compute approximate first/last frost dates from climate datasets (or let the user set them). This determines safe transplant windows.

- Growing Degree Days (GDD)
  - If plant has gddBase and gddRequirement, compute expected GDD accumulation between sow date and average first frost. If expectation is < requirement, demote the plant for that season.
  - Use a simple daily mean temp model when high fidelity weather isn't available; optionally fetch recent/predicted temperatures from a weather API for more accurate GDD.

- Microclimate & local modifiers
  - Allow garden-level microclimate notes (e.g., sheltered, windy, urban-heat) that nudge planting windows and success probability.

UI & UX suggestions
- GrowArea "What to plant next" button
  - Opens a modal showing top-K ranked plants with score breakdown and quick actions: "Create CropRecord", "Add to Plan", "View Plant"

- Board overlay
  - Color-code GrowAreas with recommended suitability (Good/Okay/Poor)
  - Show companion conflict icons when two neighboring areas have incompatible combos

- Plant detail page
  - Show planting calendar adjusted to garden's climate, suggested successors, companion matrix, and GDD curve to expected harvest

- Garden setup flow
  - Prompt for geo-location when creating a garden (optional). On decline, recommendations fallback to generic temperate assumptions and require user-provided seasonality.

Edge cases & fallback strategies
- Missing plant metadata: fall back to family-level rules and safe defaults (e.g., assume medium hardiness, neutral companions)
- No geo-location: ask user or use garden owner's account locale to infer approximate zone
- Incomplete weather access (rate limits): use historical averages and cache results
- Conflicting companion rules: use scoring and show conflict reasons; provide override button for users who know local exceptions

Tests & validation
- Unit tests
  - Rotation detection and penalty function
  - Seasonal fit checks (planting window and GDD math)
  - Companion scoring aggregation
  - API contract tests for recommendations endpoint

- Integration/E2E
  - Playwright test for "What to plant next" flow using seeded garden with history

MVP implementation plan (conservative)
1. Garden geo-location: add optional lat/lon/timezone fields and simple UI prompt during garden creation (0.5 day)
2. Plant metadata: add additive fields (family, growingTempRangeC, frostTolerance, gddBase/gddRequirement, companion lists). Seed 20–30 common plants (1 day)
3. CropRecord denormalization: store recordedPlantFamily for quick checks (0.25 day)
4. Recommendation endpoint: implement deterministic scorer using rotation + seasonality + simple companion scoring (1–2 days)
5. Frontend: "What to plant next" button + modal + quick create action (1 day)
6. Tests: unit tests for scorer and an E2E Playwright spec (0.5–1 day)

Estimated total: ~4–6 developer-days for an MVP

Potential extensions (phase 2+)
- Weather integration + live GDD calculation
- Soil test integration (pH/nutrients) and sensor inputs
- Import plant metadata from public datasets
- ML-based personalization using user feedback and success metrics
- Shared public planting plans and region templates

Security & privacy considerations
- Geo-location is sensitive personal data — treat as optional and store with clear consent; document in privacy policy.
- If integrating third-party weather APIs, do not leak user locations unnecessarily; use garden-level anonymized lookups if feasible.

Next steps I can take for you
- Draft the DB migration and DTO changes for Plant and Garden (safe additive SQL/Kotlin migration)
- Implement the recommendation endpoint and unit tests
- Create the frontend modal and an E2E test

Tell me which next step you'd like me to implement and I will start coding it. If you want changes to the doc (tone, level of detail, or additional sections), say which parts to update and I'll edit it.

# Additional proposals: Weather alerts, Monetization (Freemium), Data Sources, and Extra Features

Below are additional features, monetization ideas, data-source recommendations, and product refinements you asked me to add to this spec.

## Weather-alerts & proactive plant-care notifications (premium candidate)
- Feature summary
  - When Garden geo-location and a weather integration are enabled, the app can proactively notify users about upcoming extreme or unusual temperature events (frost risk, late cold snap, heat wave, hard freeze, sudden prolonged wet or dry period).
  - Notifications should identify which of the user's plants are most at-risk and include short, actionable, ecological care tips (e.g., "cover seedlings with frost cloth tonight", "shade/netting recommended during heat wave", "increase irrigation frequency for these beds").

- Why make this a premium feature
  - High value: timely alerts directly prevent loss and increase perceived ROI for users.
  - Server & API costs: requires weather API usage and background processing for many gardens — suitable for monetization.
  - Freemium approach: provide limited alerts (e.g., major frost/warning only) on the free tier and richer alerts (custom thresholds, multi-day forecasts, plant-by-plant care plans and SMS/push delivery) to subscribers.

- Implementation notes
  - Run a nightly (or hourly for subscribers) job that fetches forecast data for gardens with geo-location.
  - For each garden, compute event likelihood (frost/heat) and cross-join with active/scheduled crops and their frostTolerance/growingTempRange/gddRequirement.
  - Store alert history and allow users to snooze/acknowledge alerts.
  - Privacy: allow users to opt-in to forecast monitoring and alerts; respect location-sharing preferences.

- Suggested premium tiers for alerts
  - Free: daily summary email (low frequency) and in-app major frost/heat warnings.
  - Premium: hourly push/SMS, plant-level care instructions, predicted impact score, automatic task creation (e.g., "cover beds"), historic weather context, and exportable alert logs.

## Monetization & Freemium strategy (make the free tier feel premium)
- Product philosophy
  - Make the free tier genuinely useful and delightful (core plant tracking, basic recommendations, planting calendar, task reminders, and the ability to record harvest and quality) so users become engaged and retained.
  - Reserve advanced predictive/automation features for paid tiers: high-frequency weather alerts, personalized GDD forecasts, advanced planner and multi-garden analytics, integrations (e.g., sensor or paid weather APIs), seed-shopping / marketplace integrations, and priority support.

- Feature partition suggestions
  - Free features (must feel premium)
    - Core CRUD for Gardens/GrowAreas/Plants/CropRecords
    - Basic "What to plant next" recommendations without live weather (uses historical averages and family/rotation rules)
    - Plant detail pages with companion info, planting windows (generalized), and manual calendar
    - Record keeping: harvest logging and manual yield-based notes
    - One saved planting plan/template and community templates browsing
  - Premium features (subscription)
    - Real-time weather-driven recommendations & high-frequency alerts
    - Plant-level care instructions tied to forecast events (frost/heat/wet/dry)
    - Advanced planner with multi-season rotation templates, auto-scheduling, and multi-garden planning
    - More saved templates and private/public sharing features
    - Priority support and data export (CSV / JSON backups)
    - Integrations: sensor inputs (soil moisture/pH), paid weather APIs, and seed supplier links

- Pricing & packaging ideas (examples)
  - Freemium + one paid plan: $5–8/month or $50–80/year (discounted annual), aimed at home gardeners.
  - Tiered plans for pros (small farms, community gardens): add multi-garden support, team access, and bulk import/export.
  - Trial: 14–30 day trial with premium features enabled to showcase value.

- Conversion nudges (ethical and helpful)
  - Show the concrete benefit of premium features in-context (e.g., "This alert would have been caught by Premium monitoring last season and saved X% of your crop")
  - Allow short previews (e.g., one-time simulated forecast) that show how premium insights would have changed a decision.

## Where to get plant metadata (trusted sources and strategies)
- Recommended public/open sources (suitable for seeding a plant database)
  - OpenFarm (openfarm.cc): community-contributed plant guides and metadata, permissive licensing for reuse.
  - GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility): species occurrences and taxonomy (good for botanical names and taxon IDs).
  - Plants For A Future (pfaf.org): data about edible & medicinal uses and growing conditions (check license before bulk import).
  - World Flora Online / The Plant List / IPNI: authoritative taxonomic names and families.
  - USDA PLANTS database (US-specific): comprehensive plant metadata and distribution (public domain for US data).

- Commercial/APIs (useful but costed or restricted)
  - Trefle API: plant data API (has rate limits and commercial terms) — good for richer images and properties.
  - Plant.id: species ID and images (useful for user-uploaded photos, but commercial)

- Strategy for correctness and licensing
  - Prefer open datasets for bulk seeding and cite sources in the app.
  - Normalize family names and taxonomic identifiers to avoid duplicates.
  - Curated manual review: allow community edits and admin curation for correctness.
  - Add provenance metadata to each Plant entry (source, lastVerifiedDate, confidence).

## Where to get geodata & climate information
- Geolocation & reverse geocoding
  - Ask users for lat/lon or use browser/device geolocation (explicit consent).
  - Reverse-geocoding / place names: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free with usage limits), Google Maps Geocoding API (paid). Cache results and respect rate limits and TOS.

- Climate & weather data sources
  - Free / open
    - Open-Meteo / Meteostat: historical and forecast weather APIs with permissive use.
    - WorldClim / CHELSA / ERA5 (climatology datasets) for long-term normals and GDD baseline calculations.
    - NOAA and PRISM (US-focused) for high-quality historical data.
    - MET Norway — Frost & Locationforecast:
      - Frost (https://frost.met.no): MET Norway's climate and observation platform suitable for historical observations, normals, and station data. Good for deriving frost dates, long-term Tmin/Tmax series, and climatology-based GDD baselines.
      - Locationforecast (https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation): a reliable public forecast API for short- and medium-range forecast data; useful for GDD projections and imminent frost/heat alerts.
      - Usage notes: MET Norway requires requests to include a descriptive User-Agent header (including contact info) and encourages caching to reduce load. Check MET Norway's terms and attribution requirements before production use.


- Hardiness zones and frost dates
  - USDA hardiness map for the US; otherwise use Köppen/WWF maps or compute frost dates from historical daily Tmin/Tmax.
  - Consider offering a user override for hardiness zone if automated lookup seems off.

- Privacy and caching
  - Respect user consent to store lat/lon; consider rounding/obfuscating coordinates if you plan to use them for market analytics.
  - Cache weather lookups per garden and apply rate-limited refreshes (hourly/daily) depending on subscription tier.

## Feature: Plant list, box count calculation, and layout suggestion
- Problem
  - Users maintain a wishlist of plants they want to grow — they need to map that wishlist to physical garden-space (beds/boxes) and know how many boxes or rows to allocate.

- Proposal
  - Allow users to build a "Plant Shopping / Wishlist" with desired quantity (e.g., 10 tomato seedlings, 2 rows of carrots).
  - For each selected plant, derive recommended spacing and per-box capacity from Plant metadata (spacing, plantWidth, recommendedPerSquareMeter).
  - Present an automated recommendation:
    - Number of boxes/bed-length required, using user's defined box size (e.g., 1m x 1m) or GrowArea dimensions.
    - Suggested arrangement per box (rows, square-footing, companion pairing suggestions using companionLikes)
    - Use the user's historical yields and transplant success to recommend quantity adjustments (e.g., if tomatoes historically produced poor yields, suggest fewer plants or replace with a hardier cultivar)

- UI flow
  - Wishlist -> Calculate required boxes button -> show visual layout preview and a compact packing plan with quick actions (add to planting schedule, buy seeds)

- Algorithm notes
  - Use simple packing rules (greedy fit by row or square-foot method) for MVP.
  - Respect plant spacing, shading/height (tall plants on north edge in northern hemisphere), and companion compatibility.

## Feature: Post-harvest soil-improvement suggestions (ecological only)
- Problem
  - Users record harvest quantity and quality; we use that signal to recommend ecological soil amendments or practices to improve future yields.

- Data & signals
  - Inputs: last crop family, recorded yield quality rating, recorded issues (pests, nutrient deficiency symptoms), soil PH if available, weather context during season.

- Suggested ecological interventions (non-synthetic)
  - Compost & compost top-up: recommended when general low-yield or multi-crop depletion is detected.
  - Cover crops / green manures: recommend species (clover, vetch, winter rye, buckwheat) based on season and garden zone to restore nitrogen or soil structure.
  - Nitrogen-fixing legumes: suggest for following season after heavy feeders.
  - Mulching & organic matter: increase water retention and microbial activity.
  - Mineral amendments (natural): rock dust / basalt meal, dolomitic lime (if pH low and permitted), gypsum for structure (recommend after a soil test and provide conservative dosing guidance).
  - Deep-rooted bio-drainers: recommend daikon radish or other taproot cover crops to break compaction.
  - Mycorrhizal inoculants & microbial compost teas: present as optional ecological-biological options (flag with caveats about variable efficacy and sourcing).

- UI & messaging
  - After harvest, prompt user: "Yield quality: Poor/OK/Good — Get recommended ecological actions" and provide short, actionable steps with links to learn more.
  - Offer to add a soil-improvement task to the planner with suggested timing (e.g., sow a green manure this autumn).

- Cautions
  - Encourage soil testing before mineral amendments; provide safe default suggestions and dosing guidance when available.

## Feature: Pest protection & Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
- What to provide
  - A searchable pest/disease index linked to Plant entries (commonPestsDiseases), including lifecycle, signs, and ecological control strategies.
  - Actionable IPM steps: cultural controls (crop rotation, sanitation, trap crops), biological controls (predatory insects, nematodes), mechanical controls (barriers, sticky traps), and approved organic sprays (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis for caterpillars, neem for some pests) — always include usage notes and emphasize non-synthetic approaches.
  - Companion-planting-based pest reduction suggestions (e.g., attract beneficials with umbels, push-pull strategies).

- Premium additions
  - Premium users get prioritized, personalized pest alerts based on local forecasts and confirmed regional outbreaks and step-by-step remediation plans.

- Data sources for pests
  - University extension services (e.g., university IPM pages), extension publications (often region-specific and public domain), and curated community reports.

## Wrap-up: how these new features fit the earlier roadmap
- Weather-driven alerts and premium monitoring slot naturally into Phase 1–2 of the recommendation work once garden geo-location and weather integrations exist.
- Plant metadata and geodata sources recommended above provide provenance and licensing guidance so we can seed a high-quality plant DB and scale it responsibly.
- Plant-list -> box allocation and post-harvest soil advice leverage the same Plant metadata and CropRecord history we planned to add; they are low-risk feature expansions that increase retention and perceived value.

# New feature: GPT-powered chatbot (integrated via MCP)

This section outlines a conversational assistant (chatbot) powered by a GPT model and integrated into GardenTime using the MCP connector mechanism you mentioned. The assistant provides contextual, explainable, and actionable guidance about planting, pest control, soil improvement, and the app's recommendations. It can be offered as a freemium/premium feature depending on level of assistance, live-lookups, or push capabilities.

Goals
- Give users a friendly, on-demand advisor that can answer garden-specific questions using the user's garden data (CropRecords, Plants, GrowAreas, recent weather) plus authoritative plant metadata.
- Enable retrieval-augmented answers so the assistant cites internal data and documents (plant DB entries, extension sources, and our docs) rather than hallucinating.
- Integrate with MCP for secure, auditable connector operations and to allow routing tasks through the backend (e.g., create CropRecords, schedule tasks, query weather, or fetch plant pages).
- Make premium-only features optional: prioritized alerts, SMS/push follow-ups, or 1:1 coaching-style explanations.

Key user-facing capabilities
- Ask natural-language questions like:
  - "Which crops should I plant in bed A this month?"
  - "I have poor tomato yields — what's ecologically safe to add?"
  - "What should I do for a predicted frost tomorrow?"
  - "Show me companion planting combos for brassicas"
- Contextual recommendations: the assistant uses active garden context (geo, soil pH if provided, last crops) to give targeted steps.
- Action shortcuts: from a chat response the user can click actions (create CropRecord, add to wishlist, schedule a task, or view plant detail).
- Evidence & citations: RAG-based responses include links to plant entries, pest pages, or external sources when relevant.
- Conversation memory: short-term during a session; optionally store conversation logs (with consent) to improve context and personalized follow-ups.

Architecture overview (high level)
- Frontend: chat widget (React/Next) embedded in Garden or GrowArea pages. Sends user messages and receives response blocks + suggested actions.
- Backend (app server): MCP-connected service that mediates chat requests, enforces access control, and composes retrieval prompts.
- Retrieval layer: a lightweight vector DB (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus, or an open alternative) containing:
  - Plant metadata snippets (plant pages, companion rules, pest/IPM notes)
  - Docs (the content of `docs/` — including this specification)
  - Garden-specific summaries (denormalized crop history, recent weather summary, microclimate notes)
- LLM layer via MCP: a connector that calls the selected GPT model (self-hosted or API like OpenAI/Anthropic) with retrieval context. MCP handles credentials, routing, and observability.
- Actions & tools: the backend exposes a small set of callable actions the assistant can suggest (createCropRecord, scheduleTask, fetchForecast). These are gated and auditable by MCP.

RAG / prompt flow (simplified)
1. User message arrives at backend with gardenId and optional growAreaId.
2. Backend composes retrieval queries: fetch top-N vector results from the vector DB relevant to the garden and the user query, plus structured garden context (geo, last crops, soil pH).
3. Compose a system prompt that includes: explicit instruction to prefer evidence, to not hallucinate, to name sources, and to limit health/safety/pesticide recommendations to ecological options only unless user asks otherwise.
4. Call the LLM via MCP with the system prompt, retrieved docs, and conversation history.
5. Receive model output, parse suggested actions (if any), and return response to frontend with sources and action buttons.

Security, privacy & safety
- Consent: require explicit user consent before the assistant can access and store garden data or third-party weather lookups.
- Data minimization: send only the minimal garden context necessary to answer the question (garden summary, recent crops, plant IDs) rather than raw personal identifiers.
- Auditing: use MCP to log connector calls and action invocations for traceability. Store chat transcripts only if the user opts in; provide delete/export options.
- Content guardrails: system prompts must enforce ecological-first advice, caution on pesticide use, and explicit disclaimers. For any potentially harmful recommendations, require an additional confirmation step.
- Rate limits & cost control: throttle usage per user and offer premium tiers for higher limits.

Citation & provenance
- Every substantive recommendation should include short citations:
  - Internal: Plant entry slug (link), CropRecord timestamp, or `docs/` section.
  - External: link to source dataset or extension page when the assistant references facts (e.g., "according to OpenFarm, plant spacing is ...").
- Include a confidence score or provenance note if the assistant's answer relies on incomplete metadata.

Monetization & gating
- Freemium behavior
  - Free users: access to the assistant for basic factual Q&A, short context-limited help (e.g., one-turn answers using family-level default metadata), and a limited number of free retrievals per month.
  - Premium users: unlimited or higher quota, garden-specific proactivity (push alerts + scheduled nudges), advanced actions (auto-plan creation), and priority uptime.
- Examples of premium-only chat capabilities:
  - Hourly forecast-driven messages and SMS pushes
  - Assisted multi-season planning with export
  - Batch operations (apply recommended rotation template to many beds)

MVP scope and acceptance criteria
- MVP feature set (smallest useful implementation)
  - Chat widget on Garden/GrowArea pages
  - Backend mediator that performs RAG using `docs/` and plant pages seeded into a vector store
  - LLM calls via MCP for answer generation (single-shot retrieval + response)
  - Actionable buttons: view plant and create CropRecord (action requires confirmation)
  - Citations for every answer (at least internal sources)

- Acceptance criteria
  1. User can open the chat widget and ask a garden-specific question; the assistant returns an answer that references at least one internal source.
  2. The assistant offers a clickable "Create CropRecord" action which, when confirmed by the user, creates a CropRecord for that garden (backend call succeeds and is logged).
  3. Chat requests are routed through MCP and connector calls are auditable (logs exist).
  4. Free-tier rate limits are enforced and premium users see higher quotas.

Implementation notes & pragmatic choices
- Vector DB: start with a lightweight, self-hosted open option (e.g., Milvus + FAISS) or a managed small-tier Pinecone/Weaviate for ease of operations.
- Chunking & embeddings: create short document chunks for plant pages, pest/IPM pages, and docs. Use an embedding model compatible with your LLM provider.
- Controls: implement a short system prompt template that enforces ecological-first guidance and safe behavior. Keep this template editable by admins.
- Offline fallback: if MCP/LLM is unreachable, show a graceful fallback: "Assistant temporarily offline — here are suggested articles" linking to plant pages and docs.

UX details
- Place chat launcher on the bottom-right of the app and contextual chat buttons on GrowArea and Plant pages ("Ask about this grow area") so the assistant knows context automatically.
- Show answer cards with: main text, sources list, estimated confidence, and action buttons (Create CropRecord, Schedule Task, Add to Wishlist).
- Conversation history for the session is visible in the widget but is cleared after a configurable time; persisted transcripts only with consent.

Costs & operational considerations
- LLM API costs: factor per-token costs; consider using smaller models for short answers and larger models for complex planning tasks reserved for premium users.
- Weather lookups and retrievals: caching and rate limiting will reduce costs; premium tiers can pay for higher refresh cadence.
- MCP provides connector-level credentials and observability but may add its own usage cost depending on provider/pricing.

Testing & QA
- Unit tests for prompt composition and action parsing
- Integration tests simulating RAG flows and verifying that answers contain expected citations
- E2E tests for the chat widget + action invocation (mock LLM in CI for determinism)

Next steps if you want me to implement this
1. Design the minimal backend endpoints and the schema for chat sessions and action webhooks.
2. Provision a small vector DB and seed it with `docs/` and a subset of Plant pages.
3. Wire a simple chat widget in the Next.js frontend and a backend route that routes prompts through MCP to the LLM and returns results.
4. Add acceptance tests (unit + integration) and a Playwright spec for the chat flow.
