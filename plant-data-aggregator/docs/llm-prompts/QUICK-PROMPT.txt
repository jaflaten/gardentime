You are extracting plant growing attributes from a gardening guide to populate a plant database.

Extract the following information and output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

{
  "commonName": "string (singular form, e.g., 'Tomato' not 'Tomatoes')",
  "cycle": "ANNUAL|PERENNIAL|BIENNIAL",
  "sunNeeds": "FULL_SUN|PART_SHADE|SHADE",
  "waterNeeds": "LOW|MODERATE|HIGH|FREQUENT",
  "rootDepth": "SHALLOW|MEDIUM|DEEP",
  "growthHabit": "BUSH|VINE|CLIMBER|ROOT|LEAF|FRUITING",
  "soilTempMinF": "number or null",
  "soilTempOptimalF": "number or null",
  "frostTolerant": "boolean",
  "spacingMin": "number (inches) or null",
  "spacingMax": "number (inches) or null",
  "plantingDepthInches": "number or null",
  "containerSuitable": "boolean",
  "requiresStaking": "boolean",
  "requiresPruning": "boolean",
  "edibleParts": ["array of: fruit, leaf, root, seed, flower, stem"],
  "daysToMaturityMin": "number or null",
  "daysToMaturityMax": "number or null",
  "wateringInchesPerWeek": "number or null",
  "fertilizingFrequencyWeeks": "number or null",
  "mulchRecommended": "boolean",
  "notes": "brief summary of special requirements or care tips"
}

Extraction Rules:
- cycle: Look for "annual", "perennial", "biennial"
- sunNeeds: "8-10 hours" = FULL_SUN, "afternoon shade" = PART_SHADE
- waterNeeds: "2 inches/week" or "frequently" = FREQUENT, "drought tolerant" = LOW
- rootDepth: "deep watering/roots" = DEEP, lettuce/radish = SHALLOW
- growthHabit: fruit crops = FRUITING, climbers = CLIMBER, leafy = LEAF
- frostTolerant: "won't tolerate frost" = false
- spacing: Extract from "24-36 inches" = spacingMin: 24, spacingMax: 36
- containerSuitable: "grows in pots" = true
- requiresStaking: "stake" or "cage" mentioned = true
- requiresPruning: "pinch", "trim", "prune" mentioned = true
- edibleParts: tomato = ["fruit"], lettuce = ["leaf"], carrot = ["root"]
- Extract all numbers: temps, spacing, watering amounts, fertilizing frequency
- notes: Summarize key points not in other fields (under 200 chars)
