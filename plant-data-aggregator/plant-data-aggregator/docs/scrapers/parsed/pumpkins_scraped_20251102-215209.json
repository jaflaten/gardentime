It’s crucial to mix aged manure and/or compost into the soil. Learn more about preparing the soil for planting. When to Plant Pumpkins Pumpkins are sensitive to the cold. Do not sow seeds directly until well after the danger of frost is past and the soil has thoroughly warmed to a temperature between 65° and 95°F (18° to 35°C). See your Planting Calendar by zip code. Where the growing season is very short, start by sowing indoors in peat pots, 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost. Then, harden off seedlings before transplanting into warm, aged manure/compost-enriched soil. Want pumpkins in time for Halloween? Plant in the North from late May and in the extreme South from early July. Look at the seed packet for how many days until harvest. Count backward from a week or so before Halloween. Don’t plant too early or they’ll rot! How to Plant Pumpkins Vining pumpkins require a minimum of 50 to 100 square feet per hill. If you are short on space, ensure the vines are directed to the outer edge of the garden bed. Sow seeds either in rows 8 feet apart or plant in hills 4 feet apart. A hill does not mean the soil has to be mounded; it’s a spot containing a group of plants or seeds. However, mounded hills warm soil quickly (so seeds germinate faster) and aid with drainage and pest control. Prepare hills by digging down 12 to 15 inches and mixing/filling in with lots of aged manure and/or compost. In rows, sow seeds 6 to 12 inches apart. Once seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to one plant every 18 to 36 inches. In hills, set seeds 1 inch deep with 4 or 5 seeds per hill. Keep seeds moist until germination. When seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to two or three plants per hill by snipping out unwanted plants. Plant miniature varieties one inch deep, with two or three seeds every 2 feet in the row. Rows should be 6 to 8 feet apart, with seedlings thinned to the best plant every 2 feet when they have their first true leaves.

  "careInstructions" : "### Growing\nUse row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. However, remember to remove covers before flowering to allow pollination. Bees are essential for pollination, so be mindful when using insecticides to kill bugs or fungicides to control fungi. If you must use it, apply only in the late afternoon or early evening, when blossoms are closed for the day. To attract more bees, try placing a bee house in your garden. Or, grow colorful flowers near the patch. Pumpkins need 1 inch of water per week. Water deeply, in the morning and on very hot afternoons, especially during fruit set. Avoid watering foliage and fruit unless it’s a sunny day. Dampness invites rot and disease. Add mulch around your pumpkins to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and discourage pests. Weed gently; pumpkins have shallow roots that can be easily damaged. Also, take care not to damage the delicate vines; the quality of the fruit depends on them. Side-dress with aged manure or compost mixed with water. Small vine varieties can be trained to grow up a trellis. Larger varieties can be trained upward, too, to support the fruit, usually with netting or old stockings. Pumpkins are heavy feeders. Side-dress with aged manure or compost mixed with water. When plants are about 1 foot tall, just before vines begin to run, fertilize regularly with a high-nitrogen formula. Just before the blooming period, switch to a high-phosphorus formula fertilizer. If your first flowers aren’t forming fruits, that’s normal. Both male and female blossoms need to open. Be patient. How to Grow a Bigger Pumpkin After a few pumpkins have formed, pinch off the fuzzy ends of each vine to stop vine growth and focus plant energy on the fruit. Pruning the vines may help with space and fruit formation. Pumpkins produce main vines (from the base/center of the plant), secondary vines from the main ones, and tertiary vines from the secondary vines. All may have flowers. Once the fruit has developed, prune the main and secondary vines to 10 to 15 feet and remove the tertiary vines, if desired. Bury the cut tips in the soil. Or, gardeners looking for a “prize for size” pumpkin might select 2 or 3 prime candidates and remove all other fruit and vines. As the fruit develops, turn them—with great care not to hurt the vine or stem—to encourage an even shape. Slip a thin board or stone or piece of plastic mesh under pumpkins to protect them from rotting on the soil. To grow a giant pumpkin, try ‘Dill’s Atlantic Giant’ jumbo variety. Fruit can grow to 200 pounds on 25-foot vines. Plants need 130 to 160 days to mature, so start seedlings indoors, then thin to the best 1 or 2 to plants. Feed heavily and cultivate shallowly. Remove the first two or three female flowers to generate more leaf surface before a plant sets fruit. Allow one fruit to develop. Remove all other female flowers. Ensure the vine does not root down near the joints to avoid breakage. Learn more about growing prize-winning pumpkins!\n\n### What Are Gourds?

  "harvestInfo" : "### Harvesting\nYour best bet is to harvest pumpkins when they are fully mature—and not before. They will keep best this way. Do not pick pumpkins off the vine because they have reached your desired size. (If you want small pumpkins, grow a small variety.) Harvest on a dry day after the plants have died back and the skins are hard. The skin of a ripening pumpkin turns a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties), and the stem hardens. Thump the pumpkin with a finger; the rind will feel hard and sound hollow. Press a fingernail into the pumpkin’s skin; if it resists puncture, it is ripe. Carefully cut the fruit off the vine with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear it. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin. Leave 3 to 4 inches of stem to increase its keeping time. Handle pumpkins very gently, or they may bruise. Never carry a pumpkin by its stem. How to Cure, Store, and Display Pumpkins To toughen the skin and intensify flavor, cure pumpkins in a sunny spot for about 10 days in an area that is 80º to 85º F, with 80 to 85% humidity. This is a great time to display your pumpkin on the front porch! If you’re carving a pumpkin, carve no more than 3 days before Halloween, or the pumpkin will begin to rot. After curing, store pumpkins in a cool, dry cellar or root cellar or the like at 50º to 55ºF for 2 to 3 months. Properly saved seeds should last for 6 years.

  "pestsAndDiseases" : "### Pests/Diseases\nBe aware that poor light, too much fertilizer, poor weather at bloom time, and reduced pollinating insect activity can result in poor fruit set, shape, and excessive blossom drop. Pumpkin Pests and Diseases Pest/Disease Type Symptoms Control/Prevention Anthracnose Fungus Yellow/brown/purple/black spots on leaves; sunken, dark spots on stems and fruit; spots may develop a salmon-pink, gelatinous mass; eventually, rot Destroy infected plants; choose resistant varieties; provide good drainage; avoid overhead watering; apply compost; use mulch; rotate crops Aphids Insect Misshapen/yellow leaves; distorted flowers/fruit; sticky “honeydew” (excrement); sooty, black mold Grow companion plants; knock off with water spray; apply insecticidal soap; put banana or orange peels around plants; wipe leaves with a 1 to 2 percent solution of dish soap (no additives) and water every 2 to 3 days for 2 weeks; add native plants to invite beneficial insects Blossom-end rot Disorder Dark, water-soaked spots on blossom end of fruit (opposite stem) may enlarge and become sunken and leathery Caused by lack of calcium in fruit, often due to roots failing to obtain sufficient water and/or nutrients. Remove affected fruit; plant at proper soil temperature; water deeply and evenly; use mulch; maintain proper soil pH (around 6.5) and nutrient levels; avoid excessive nitrogen; provide good drainage; prevent root damage Cucumber beetles Insect Holes in leaves/flowers; rasped fruit; plants stunted/die Handpick; mulch heavily; use row covers; destroy plants infected with bacterial wilt (Bacterial wilt signs: wilting; plants die; ends of cut stems, when pressed together for 10 seconds and pulled apart, release stringy, white sap) Downy mildew Fungus Yellow, angular spots on upper leaf surfaces that turn brown; white/purple/gray cottony growth on leaf undersides only; distorted leaves; defoliation Remove plant debris; choose resistant varieties; ensure good air circulation; avoid overhead watering Powdery mildew Fungus Typically, white spots on upper leaf surfaces expand to flour-like coating over entire leaves; foliage may yellow/die; distortion/stunting of leaves/flowers Destroy infected leaves or plants; choose resistant varieties; plant in full sun, if possible; ensure good air circulation; spray plants with 1 teaspoon baking soda dissolved in 1 quart water; destroy crop residue Mosaic virus (cucumber) Virus Varies with plant, but may include stunting, mottled green/yellow/white pattern or ringed spots on leaves/fruit; distorted leaf growth; warts on fruit Destroy infected plants; choose resistant varieties and certified virus-free seed; use row covers; disinfect tools; weed; control aphids; use mulch Stinkbugs Insect Yellow/white blotches on leaves; eggs, often keg-shape, in clusters on leaf undersides Destroy crop residue; handpick (bugs emit odor, wear gloves); destroy eggs; spray nymphs with insecticidal soap; use row covers; weed; till soil in fall Squash bugs Insect Many small, yellow/brown/black spots on leaves; wilt; scarred fruit Handpick; crush yellow/bronze egg clusters on leaf undersides; lay boards on soil and check for pests underneath each morning; remove plant debris; use row covers; rotate crops Squash vine borer Insect Vines wilt suddenly; plants die; mushy area and /or green to orange-yellow, sawdust-like excrement on/near base of plant stem If detected early, slit infested stem lengthwise halfway to remove borer larvae, then bury the cut in moist soil to encourage rooting; wrap seedling stems in aluminum foil collar; catch moths with yellow sticky traps; use row covers if no pests previously, but uncover before flowering; destroy crop residue; rotate crops",

Have you ever dreamed of having a pumpkin patch, but you just don&#8217;t know where to start? How do you know when pumpkins are ready to be picked? Can you leave them on the vine too long? How do you cure a pumpkin so that it lasts? See our Pumpkin Growing Guide, which covers everything from planting to&nbsp;harvesting.</p><h2>About&nbsp;Pumpkins</h2><p>Did you know pumpkins have been grown in North America for almost 5,000 years?&nbsp;This native plant is a lot of fun to&nbsp;grow.</p><p>There are two requirements for growing this winter squash: 1) Having the space to grow them [ideally 1,000 square feet per plant for giant types, 50 to 100 square feet for regular-size varieties, and about 15 to 36 square feet for miniature types] and&nbsp;2) having a long growing season [generally 75 to 100 frost-free days]. Growers in northern locations need to plant by late May; in southern states, plant by early&nbsp;July.&nbsp;</p><p>Pumpkins do require a lot of nourishment. That said, pumpkins are easy to&nbsp;maintain.</p><p><em>Of autumn&#8217;s wine, now drink your fill;</em><br><em>The frost&#8217;s on the pumpkin, and snow&#8217;s on the hill.&nbsp;</em><br>–<em>The Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac</em>,&nbsp;1993</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-767aaf6175c208d79f6cbd0a8d9269f71f5bcd1c0c9806ff092b2a4f66fe12c0\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/how-grow-giant-pumpkin\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow a Giant Pumpkin</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/winter-squash\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Winter Squash: Butternut, Acorn, Spaghetti &amp; More</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/types-gourds\" hreflang=\"und\">What Are Gourds?

It&#8217;s crucial to mix aged manure and/or compost into the soil. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/preparing-soil-planting\">preparing the soil for planting</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Pumpkins</h3><p>Pumpkins are sensitive to the cold. Do not sow seeds directly until <strong>well after </strong>the danger of frost is past and the soil has thoroughly warmed to a temperature between 65° and 95°F (18° to 35°C).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/planting-calendar\">See your Planting Calendar by zip code</a>.</p><ul><li>Where the growing season is very short, start by sowing indoors in peat pots, 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost. Then, harden off seedlings before transplanting into warm, aged manure/compost-enriched&nbsp;soil.</li><li>Want pumpkins in time for Halloween? Plant in the North from late May and in the extreme South from early July. Look at the seed packet for how many days until harvest. Count backward from a week or so before Halloween. Don&#8217;t plant too early or they&#8217;ll&nbsp;rot!</li></ul><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Pumpkins</h3><ul><li>Vining&nbsp;pumpkins&nbsp;require a minimum of 50 to 100 square feet&nbsp;per&nbsp;hill.&nbsp;If you are short on space, ensure the vines are directed to the outer edge of the garden&nbsp;bed.</li><li>Sow seeds either in rows 8 feet apart or plant in hills 4 feet apart. <span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:20.3999996185303px;\">A hill does not mean the soil has to be mounded; it&#8217;s a&nbsp;spot containing a group of plants or seeds.&nbsp;However, mounded h</span>ills warm soil quickly (so seeds germinate faster) and aid with drainage and pest control. &nbsp;Prepare hills by digging down 12 to 15 inches and mixing/filling in with lots of aged manure and/or&nbsp;compost.</li><li>In rows, sow seeds 6 to 12 inches apart. Once seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to one plant every 18 to 36&nbsp;inches.</li><li>In hills, set seeds 1 inch deep with 4 or 5 seeds per hill. Keep seeds moist until germination. When seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall, thin to two or three plants per hill by snipping out unwanted&nbsp;plants.</li></ul><p>Plant miniature varieties one inch deep, with two or three seeds every 2 feet in the row. Rows should be 6 to 8 feet apart, with seedlings thinned to the best plant every 2 feet when they have their first true&nbsp;leaves.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;line-height:20.3999996185303px;\"><strong>In this video, Ben shows us his method for growing&nbsp;pumpkins!</strong></span></p><div class=\"youtube-container\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNJVDJd05Yk\" width=\"720\"></iframe></div></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Use <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-make-row-cover-tunnel\">row covers</a> to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. However, remember to remove covers before flowering to allow&nbsp;pollination.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/native-bees-best-pollinators-your-garden\">Bees</a> are essential for pollination, so be mindful when using insecticides to kill bugs or fungicides to control fungi. If you must use it, apply only in the late afternoon or early evening, when blossoms are closed for the day. To attract more bees, try placing a <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/bee-houses-solitary-bees\">bee house</a> in your garden. Or, grow colorful flowers near the&nbsp;patch.</li><li>Pumpkins need 1 inch of water per week.&nbsp;Water deeply, in the morning and on very hot afternoons, especially during fruit set. Avoid watering foliage and fruit unless it’s a sunny day. Dampness invites rot and&nbsp;disease.</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/blog/gardening/garden-journal/mulching-guide-benefits-mulch\">mulch</a> around your pumpkins to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and discourage&nbsp;pests.</li><li>Weed gently; pumpkins have shallow roots that can be easily damaged. Also, take care not to damage the delicate vines; the quality of the fruit depends on&nbsp;them.</li><li>Side-dress with aged manure or compost mixed with&nbsp;water.</li><li>Small vine varieties can be trained to grow up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-build-trellis-and-supports-climbing-vegetables\">trellis</a>.&nbsp;Larger varieties can be trained upward, too, to support the fruit, usually with netting or old&nbsp;stockings.</li><li>Pumpkins are heavy feeders. Side-dress with aged manure or compost mixed with water.&nbsp;When plants are about 1 foot tall, just before vines begin to run, fertilize regularly with a high-nitrogen formula. Just before the blooming period, switch to a high-phosphorus formula&nbsp;fertilizer.</li><li>If your first flowers aren’t forming fruits, that’s normal. Both male and female blossoms need to open. Be&nbsp;patient.</li></ul><h3>How to Grow a Bigger&nbsp;Pumpkin</h3><ul><li>After a few pumpkins have formed, pinch off the fuzzy ends of each vine to stop vine growth and focus plant&nbsp;energy on the&nbsp;fruit.</li><li>Pruning the vines may help with space and fruit formation.&nbsp;Pumpkins produce main vines (from the base/center of the plant), secondary vines from the main ones, and tertiary vines from the secondary vines. All may have flowers. Once the fruit has developed, prune the main and secondary vines to 10 to 15 feet and remove the tertiary vines, if desired. Bury the cut tips in the&nbsp;soil.</li><li>Or, gardeners looking for a “prize for size” pumpkin might select 2 or 3 prime candidates and remove all other fruit and&nbsp;vines.</li><li>As the fruit develops, turn them—with great care not to hurt the vine or stem—to encourage an even shape. Slip a thin&nbsp;board or stone or piece of plastic mesh under pumpkins to protect them from rotting on the&nbsp;soil.</li><li>To grow a giant pumpkin, try ‘Dill’s Atlantic Giant’ jumbo variety. Fruit can grow to 200 pounds on 25-foot vines. Plants need 130 to 160 days to mature, so start seedlings indoors, then thin to the best 1 or 2 to&nbsp;plants.</li><li>Feed heavily and cultivate&nbsp;shallowly.</li><li>Remove the first two or three female flowers to generate more leaf surface before a plant sets&nbsp;fruit.</li><li>Allow one fruit to develop. Remove all other female&nbsp;flowers.</li><li>Ensure the vine does not root down near the joints to avoid&nbsp;breakage.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/how-grow-giant-pumpkin\">Learn more about growing prize-winning&nbsp;pumpkins!</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://gardenplanner.almanac.com/\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/Almanac%20Staff/growveg_pumpkins.jpeg\" alt=\"Spacing for Pumpkins\" width=\"720\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        <p>Every pumpkin has a best purpose. When choosing a pumpkin, think about what you want to do with it. All pumpkins are technically edible, but ornamentals are better for carving, and other pumpkins are best for&nbsp;cooking.</p><h4>Miniature&nbsp;Pumpkins</h4><p>Miniature pumpkins are very productive and easy to grow, sometimes producing up to a dozen fruits per&nbsp;plant.</p><ul><li><strong>‘Jack Be Little’</strong>, a miniature variety, is dual purpose. Store-bought shiny (painted) ones make an ideal decoration for a holiday table. Remove the seeds from farm- or homegrown specimens and then bake them for a tiny&nbsp;treat. Vine variety. Days to maturity: 90 to&nbsp;100.</li><li><strong>‘We-B-Little’</strong> is an All-America Selection winner, and ‘Munchkin’ is another great miniature&nbsp;pumpkin.</li></ul><h4>Pumpkins for&nbsp;Carving</h4><ul><li><strong>‘Autumn Gold’ </strong>is great for carving and decorating. All-America Selection winner. Vine variety. Excellent for jack-o’-lanterns. Days to maturity are generally 100 to&nbsp;120.</li><li>The larger <strong>‘Magic Lantern’</strong> and <strong>‘Merlin’ </strong>are great for carving and&nbsp;decorating.</li></ul><h4>Giant&nbsp;Pumpkins</h4><ul><li><strong>‘Dill’s Atlantic Giant’</strong> jumbo variety can grow to 200 pounds. Great for those who want to grow a ginormous pumpkin. Vines will spread to 25 feet, so space is a must. Days to maturity are 130 to 160, so plant early! Thin to the best one or two plants. Feed heavily but keep cultivation shallow. Remove the first two or three female flowers after the plants start to bloom so that the plants grow larger with more leaf surface before setting fruit. Allow a single fruit to develop and pick off all female flowers that develop after this fruit has set on the plant. Take care that the vine doesn’t root down near the joints to avoid&nbsp;breakage.</li><li><strong>‘Big Max’</strong>, <strong>‘Big Moon’</strong>, <strong>‘Jack O’ Lantern’</strong>, and <strong>‘Funny Face’</strong> are some of the best giant pumpkins&nbsp;for&nbsp;carving.</li></ul><h4>Perfect Pumpkins for&nbsp;Pies</h4><ul><li><strong>‘Sugar Treat’</strong>&nbsp;is excellent for cooking and baking. Days to maturity are generally 100 to 120. <strong>‘Hijinks’</strong> and <strong>‘Baby Bear’</strong> are both All-America Selection winners and have sweet flesh&nbsp;for pumpkin&nbsp;pie.</li><li><strong>‘Cinderella’s Carriage’ </strong>is also perfect for pies or&nbsp;soups.</li><li><strong>‘Peanut Pumpkin’ </strong>also produces very sweet flesh and can be great in pumpkin pie or pumpkin&nbsp;puree.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"a green pumpkin turning orange on the vine\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"269d5548-01aa-41ee-b1c7-c6a91a812a73\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/images/pumpkins%20Arina%20P%20Habich%20shutterstock_0.jpg\" width=\"1605\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>Image:&nbsp;Arina P Habich/Shutterstock</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Colorful Decorative&nbsp;Pumpkins</h4><ul><li><strong>‘Jarrahdale’</strong> has blue-green skin and makes for great&nbsp;decorations.</li><li><strong>‘Pepitas Pumpkin’</strong> is orange and&nbsp;green.</li><li><strong>‘Super Moon’</strong> is a large white&nbsp;pumpkin.</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest block--field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-harvest field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Harvesting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n        <p>Your best bet is to harvest pumpkins when they are fully mature—and not before.

Press a fingernail into the pumpkin&#8217;s skin;&nbsp;if it resists puncture, it is&nbsp;ripe.</li><li><span style=\"font-size:1.125rem;\">Carefully cut the fruit off the vine with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear it.&nbsp;Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin. Leave 3 to 4 inches of stem to increase its keeping&nbsp;time.</span></li><li>Handle pumpkins very gently, or they may bruise. Never carry a pumpkin by its&nbsp;stem.</li></ul><h3>How to Cure, Store, and Display&nbsp;Pumpkins</h3><ul><li>To toughen the skin and intensify flavor, cure pumpkins in a sunny spot for about 10 days in an area that is 80º to 85º F, with 80 to 85% humidity. This is a great time to display your pumpkin on the front porch! If you&#8217;re carving a pumpkin, carve no more than 3 days before Halloween, or the pumpkin will begin to&nbsp;rot.</li><li>After curing, store pumpkins in a cool, dry cellar or <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/how-build-root-cellar\">root cellar</a>&nbsp;or the like at 50º to 55ºF for 2 to 3&nbsp;months.</li><li>Properly saved seeds should last for 6&nbsp;years.</li></ul><p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-grow-cure-and-store-pumpkins\">this video for tips on curing and storing pumpkins</a>.</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"recommender-title block block-block-content block-block-contente8acfdbd-8aa8-4a11-9e44-f56cad64ee7a gardening-recommendations print-no\">\n  \n      <h2 class=\"block__title category-heading\">Gardening Products</h2>\n    \n\n  <div class=\"block__content\">\n    <div class=\"gardening-products-wrapper\">\n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden clearfix text-formatted field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n        <div class=\"recommender-wrapper\" data-ltk-merchandiseblock=\"49397b29-784d-45ad-ba5f-2ca9659c9feb\">\n    <script type=\"text/html\">\n       var linkRoot = \"https://store.almanac.com.com\";\n        <div class=\"prod-rec\" style=\"width: 32%\">\n            <a onclick=\"ga('send', {hitType: 'event', eventCategory: 'Products', eventAction: 'Click', eventLabel: '@Recommendation.Title', transport: 'beacon'});\" href=\"@(linkRoot + Recommendation.LinkUrl)\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <div class=\"rec-image\"><img class=\"prod-image\" src=\"@Recommendation.ImageUrl\" alt=\"View @Recommendation.Title recommended for you\" height=\"250\" /></div>\n                <p class=\"prod-title\">@Recommendation.Title</p>\n                <p>$@Recommendation.Price</p>\n                <p class=\"rec-button\">BUY NOW</p>\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </script>\n</div></p>\n      </div>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-pests block--field-blocknodeplantfield-pests flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-pests field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Pests/Diseases</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <p>Be aware that poor light, too much fertilizer, poor weather at bloom time, and reduced pollinating insect activity can result in poor fruit set, shape, and excessive blossom&nbsp;drop.</p><div class=\"plant-table\"><table><caption>Pumpkin Pests and Diseases</caption><thead><tr><th>Pest/Disease</th><th>Type</th><th>Symptoms</th><th>Control/Prevention</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/pest/anthracnose\">Anthracnose</a></th><td>Fungus</td><td>Yellow/brown/purple/black spots on leaves; sunken, dark spots on stems and fruit; spots may develop a salmon-pink, gelatinous mass; eventually, rot</td><td>Destroy infected plants; choose resistant varieties; provide good drainage; avoid overhead watering; apply compost; use mulch; rotate crops</td></tr><tr><th><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/pest/aphids\">Aphids</a></th><td>Insect</td><td>Misshapen/yellow leaves; distorted flowers/fruit; sticky “honeydew” (excrement); sooty, black mold</td><td>Grow <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/companion-planting-guide-vegetables\">companion plants</a>; knock off with water spray; apply insecticidal soap; put banana or orange peels around plants; wipe leaves with a 1 to 2 percent solution of dish soap (no additives) and water every 2 to 3 days for 2 weeks; add native plants to invite <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/beneficial-insects-garden\">beneficial insects</a></td></tr><tr><th><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/pest/blossom-end-rot\">Blossom-end rot</a></th><td>Disorder</td><td>Dark, water-soaked spots on blossom end of fruit (opposite stem) may enlarge and become sunken and leathery</td><td>Caused by lack of calcium in fruit, often due to roots failing to obtain sufficient water and/or nutrients.

pros/cons, hoping to learn about how to use the resources I have. I'm disabled & unable to do a lot of manual labor- such as digging out new garden beds/fields. I do have a horse pasture that receives 80% southern exposure daylight & aprx 10-15% shade from tall forest mid morning throughout Summer. The pasture is fallow & manure aged. Would pumpkins do well if I dug out larger planting holes, place aged compost, bonemeal, and soil into holes, fertilize regularly with fish emulsion, and let the vines ramble? \r\nThis ground drains easily, yet my plants stay healthy. Do I need to worry about grass possibly trapping moisture on the pumpkins? Are there other risks with grass that I should know?

Some of the most common causes are lack of pollinators; weather, specifically extreme heat or cold temps. Varieties differ in their reaction to temp changes. Nitrogen levels in the soil can also affect fruit set. Excess nitrogen results in vigorous vine growth and delays flowering. You might do a soil test to assess its composition. We hope this helps!</p>\r\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-124882\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"123604\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Cathy&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sun, 04/24/2022 - 20:30</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"123604\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90303\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      The Rouge Vif D’Etampes pumpkin is a gorgeous shape and color, is delicious and a keeper!
