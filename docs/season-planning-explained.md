# Season Planning Feature - Detailed Explanation

## The Problem We're Solving

Many gardeners struggle with knowing **when to start seeds indoors** before transplanting them outdoors. This is especially critical for crops like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants that need a head start before the growing season.

### Real-World Example: Growing Tomatoes in Norway

**Scenario:**
- Location: Oslo, Norway
- Last frost date: May 15 (typical for Oslo area)
- Goal: Grow tomatoes from seed

**The Challenge:**
Tomatoes need 6-8 weeks of indoor growth before they can be transplanted outdoors. If you wait until May 15 to start seeds, your tomatoes won't produce fruit until very late in the short Norwegian summer.

**The Solution:**
1. Start tomato seeds **indoors** on March 27 (7 weeks before last frost)
2. Grow seedlings on windowsill or under grow lights
3. **Transplant outdoors** on May 22 (1 week after last frost for safety)
4. **Harvest** begins around August 5 (75 days after transplanting)

Our season planning feature **automatically calculates these dates** so users don't have to!

## How It Works

### Step 1: Set Frost Dates (One-Time Setup)

Users enter their garden's climate information:
- **Last Frost Date:** The average date of the last spring frost (e.g., May 15)
- **First Frost Date:** The average date of the first fall frost (e.g., October 1)
- **Hardiness Zone:** USDA zone (e.g., 7a) - optional initially

**Where to Find Frost Dates:**
- Local gardening clubs
- Agricultural extension offices
- Online frost date calculators (by ZIP code or city)
- Ask experienced local gardeners

**Note:** Users enter these manually for MVP. Phase 2 will auto-populate from hardiness zone database.

---

### Step 2: Create a Season Plan

Users create a plan for a specific growing season:
- **Season:** Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter
- **Year:** 2025
- **Phase (Optional):** Early, Mid, or Late

**Why Phases?**
In countries like Norway with short growing seasons, gardeners use phases for succession planting:
- **Early:** First crops that can handle cool weather (peas, lettuce, kale)
- **Mid:** Main season crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash)
- **Late:** Fall crops and storage vegetables (carrots, cabbage)

**Multiple Seasons:**
Users can have multiple active season plans:
- Tropical regions: Multiple growing seasons per year
- Norway: Spring, Summer, Fall plans with different phases

---

### Step 3: Add Crops to the Plan

For each crop user wants to grow, they:
1. **Select Plant:** Choose from plant database (e.g., "Tomato")
2. **Enter Quantity:** How many plants (e.g., 6 tomato plants)
3. **Choose Grow Area:** Preferred location (e.g., "Greenhouse Box 1")
4. **Set Phase:** Early, Mid, or Late (optional)

**System Automatically Calculates:**
- ðŸ”µ **Indoor Start Date:** When to plant seeds indoors (if needed)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Transplant/Direct Sow Date:** When to move to garden
- ðŸŸ¡ **Expected Harvest Date:** When crop should be ready

---

### Step 4: Date Calculation Logic

The system uses plant-specific data to calculate optimal planting dates.

#### Plant Data (from `plant_details` table)
Each plant has:
- `weeks_before_frost_indoor`: How many weeks before last frost to start indoors
- `can_direct_sow`: Whether can be planted directly in garden
- `can_transplant`: Whether can be started indoors and moved out
- `frost_tolerance`: HARDY, SEMI_HARDY, or TENDER
- `maturity_time`: Days from planting to harvest

#### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Tomato (Transplant Only)**
```
Plant Data:
- weeks_before_frost_indoor: 7
- can_direct_sow: false
- can_transplant: true
- frost_tolerance: TENDER
- maturity_time: 75 days

Garden Data:
- last_frost_date: May 15, 2025

Calculated Dates:
- Indoor Start: May 15 - 7 weeks = March 27, 2025
- Transplant: May 15 + 1 week = May 22, 2025 (wait for safe temps)
- Expected Harvest: May 22 + 75 days = August 5, 2025
```

**Example 2: Lettuce (Both Methods)**
```
Plant Data:
- weeks_before_frost_indoor: 4
- can_direct_sow: true
- can_transplant: true
- frost_tolerance: HARDY
- maturity_time: 50 days

Garden Data:
- last_frost_date: May 15, 2025

Calculated Dates:
Option A - Indoor Start:
- Indoor Start: May 15 - 4 weeks = April 17, 2025
- Transplant: May 1, 2025 (can go earlier, it's hardy)
- Expected Harvest: May 1 + 50 days = June 20, 2025

Option B - Direct Sow:
- Direct Sow: April 17, 2025 (4 weeks before frost)
- Expected Harvest: April 17 + 50 days = June 6, 2025
```

**Example 3: Carrot (Direct Sow Only)**
```
Plant Data:
- weeks_before_frost_indoor: NULL (can't transplant)
- can_direct_sow: true
- can_transplant: false
- frost_tolerance: HARDY
- maturity_time: 70 days

Garden Data:
- last_frost_date: May 15, 2025

Calculated Dates:
- Direct Sow: April 24, 2025 (3 weeks before frost)
- Expected Harvest: April 24 + 70 days = July 3, 2025
```

### Step 5: Following the Plan

#### Dashboard Shows Upcoming Tasks
```
ðŸ“… This Week:
- ðŸ”µ Start basil seeds indoors (in 3 days)
- ðŸŸ¢ Transplant lettuce to Box 2 (in 5 days)

ðŸ“… Next Week:
- ðŸ”µ Start pepper seeds indoors (in 9 days)
- ðŸŸ¢ Direct sow carrots in Bed 1 (in 12 days)
```

#### User Actions & Status Updates

**Statuses:**
1. **PLANNED** - Crop is in the plan, no action taken yet
2. **SEEDS_STARTED** - Seeds planted indoors
3. **TRANSPLANTED** - Moved to garden (creates crop record)
4. **DIRECT_SOWN** - Planted directly in garden (creates crop record)
5. **GROWING** - Actively growing in garden
6. **COMPLETED** - Harvested

**Workflow A: Indoor Start â†’ Transplant**
```
1. User sees: "Start tomato seeds indoors (today)"
2. User marks as "Seeds Started"
   - Status changes to SEEDS_STARTED
   - Calendar shows completed (checkmark)
   
3. Later, user sees: "Transplant tomatoes to Box 1 (today)"
4. User clicks "Transplant"
   - Modal appears: "Create Crop Record"
   - Pre-filled: Plant=Tomato, GrowArea=Box 1, Date=today, Status=PLANTED
   - User confirms
   - crop_record created in database
   - planned_crop.status = TRANSPLANTED
   - planned_crop.crop_record_id = new crop record ID
   - Tomato appears on garden board immediately!
```

**Workflow B: Direct Sow**
```
1. User sees: "Direct sow carrots in Bed 1 (today)"
2. User clicks "Plant Now"
   - Modal appears: "Create Crop Record"

## Why This Matters

This feature transforms GardenTime from a simple tracking tool into a **proactive gardening assistant**. Instead of just recording what happened, we help users **plan ahead and succeed**.

For users in challenging climates (like Norway with short growing seasons), this is **essential** for maximizing harvests. For beginners, it removes the mystery and builds confidence.

By connecting season planning â†’ seed starting â†’ transplanting â†’ crop records â†’ garden board, we create a seamless workflow that guides users through the entire growing cycle.

ðŸŒ± **This is the feature that makes GardenTime indispensable for serious gardeners.**
