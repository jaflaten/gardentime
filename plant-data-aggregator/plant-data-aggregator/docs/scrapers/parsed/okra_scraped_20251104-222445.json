  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting\nOkra needs full sun and hot weather with evening temperatures that are in the 60°s (Fahrenheit) or warmer. Soil needs to be fertile and well-draining, with a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.0. Before planting, mix aged manure and/or compost into the soil. When to Plant Okra Sow okra directly into the garden 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost date and cover the plants with a 2- to 3-foot-high cold frame or grow tunnel until the weather warms up fully. Make sure that the covering is this high so that plants have room to grow. Or, to direct -sow okra seeds without any protection from the cold, wait until the soil is 65° to 75°F. Where summers are short, especially in more northern areas, start okra seeds indoors in peat pots under full light 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost. How to Plant Okra Okra’s BB-pellet-sized seeds have a hard shell. To speed germination, soak seeds for a few hours in warm water before sowing. Plant okra seeds about 1/2 to 1 inch deep and 12 to 18 inches apart in a row. You can soak the seeds overnight in tepid water to help speed up germination. If you are planting okra transplants, be sure to space them 1 to 2 feet apart to give them ample room to grow. Okra plants are tall, so space out the rows 3 to 4 feet apart.\n\n### When to Plant Okra\n- Sow okra directly into the garden 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost date and cover the plants with a 2- to 3-foot-high cold frame or grow tunnel until the weather warms up fully.

  "careInstructions" : "### Growing\nEliminate weeds when the plants are young, then mulch heavily—4 to 8 inches—to prevent more weeds. During the growing season, Joseph Masabni of Texas A&M recommends that you “cultivate around the okra plants to remove weeds and grass. To avoid damaging the okra roots, pull weeds close to the plants by hand.” Side-dress the plants with 10-10-10, aged manure, or rich compost (1/2 pound per 25 feet of row). You could also apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly. Avoid too much nitrogen, which deters flowering and encourages leafy growth. Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting. When the seedlings are about 3 inches tall, thin the plants so that they are 18 to 24 inches apart. Keep the plants well watered throughout the summer months. One inch of water per week is ideal, but use more if you are in a hot, arid region. High heat can slow the growth of okra. Prune the tops of okra plants when they reach 5 to 6 feet tall. This will result in more side branches. Prune those as needed. In warm regions, some growers cut plants to about 2 feet when productivity slows in summer. The plants grow back and produce another crop of okra.

Regardless of type, irritation does not occur when you eat okra.\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Grow vibrant, heat-loving okra for a tasty, easy-to-harvest summer crop\n\n\n### Harvesting\nWhen you harvest okra, get out the gloves and wear a long-sleeved shirt to protect yourself from the tiny spines that can make your hands and arms itch for days. Once okra is ripe, harvest every day! The pods grow so fast and ripen within a day, so you need to pick continually. Overripe okra is too tough to eat. The best pods are only 2 to 4 inches long. This is when okra is at its softest and most digestible. Cut the stem just above the cap with a knife. If the stem is too hard to cut, the pod is probably too old and should be tossed. Only one pod grows beneath each leaf, so break off the leaf after harvesting the pod. Photo credit: fz750/GettyImages Harvest often: The more you pick, the more flowers will appear, and okra goes from flowering to fruit in a few days. A severe freeze can damage pods. If one is predicted and pods are drying on the plant for seeds, cut the plant and hang it indoors to dry. Put a paper bag over it so if the pods shatter, the seeds will not be lost. In the South, regular okra plants can get too tall to harvest; if this happens, cut them back to 12 to 18 inches above the ground. This is usually done in July or August. The plants will sprout again to make a second crop. Otherwise, consider a dwarf variety! How to Store Okra To store okra, put the uncut and uncooked pods into freezer bags and keep them in the freezer. Or wash and blanch okra before freezing. Or, can okra to have it throughout the winter.\n\n### How to Grow Sweet Corn: Planting, Pollination & Harvesting Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Sweet Potatoes: Planting Slips & Harvesting Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n\n\n### How to Grow Lettuce: Sowing, Planting & Harvesting Tips for Crisp Leaves\n",

This Southern staple is showing up in gardens everywhere, and for good reason. It’s easy to grow, fun to harvest, and comes with tropical-looking flowers that would make a hibiscus blush. Whether you’re a seasoned grower or okra-curious, we’ve got all the tips to help you grow it like a garden rockstar. Let’s get&nbsp;planting!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Okra</h2><p>Many gardeners are discovering okra, and the range of this warm-weather crop has been creeping northward and gaining in popularity. This plant not only grows edible vegetables and beautiful flowers, but it is&nbsp;also rich in vitamin A and low in calories, which makes it a great addition to your&nbsp;diet.&nbsp;</p><p>If you look at the flower of okra, you’ll see a resemblance to a hibiscus flower. It’s no coincidence—okra is a member of the hibiscus&nbsp;family!</p><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/okra-flower-coloradjust_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"Okra flower\" width=\"720\" height=\"478\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-dd2dc2fa6ace03a378a67086dbae851121053533e3ab8b745389122d5d369c94\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/corn\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Sweet Corn: Planting, Pollination &amp; Harvesting Tips</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/sweet-potatoes\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Sweet Potatoes: Planting Slips &amp; Harvesting Tips</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/swiss-chard\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care &amp; Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        <p>Okra needs full sun and hot weather with&nbsp;evening temperatures that are in the 60°s (Fahrenheit) or warmer. Soil needs to be fertile and well-draining, with a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.0. Before planting, mix aged manure and/or compost into the&nbsp;soil.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Okra</h3><ul><li>Sow okra directly into the garden 3 to 4 weeks&nbsp;before the last spring <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">frost date</a>&nbsp;and cover the plants with a 2- to 3-foot-high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-make-cold-frame-step-step\">cold frame</a> or <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-make-row-cover-tunnel\">grow tunnel</a> until the weather warms up fully. Make sure that the covering is this high so that plants have room to grow. Or, to direct -sow okra seeds without any protection from the cold, wait until the soil is 65° to&nbsp;75°F.</li><li>Where summers are short, especially in more northern areas, start okra seeds indoors in peat pots under full light 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring&nbsp;frost.</li></ul><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Okra</h3><p>Okra&#8217;s <span class=\"caps\">BB</span>-pellet-sized seeds have a hard shell. To speed germination, soak seeds for a few hours in warm water before&nbsp;sowing.</p><ul><li>Plant okra seeds about 1/2&nbsp;to 1&nbsp;inch deep and 12 to 18 inches apart in a row. You can soak the seeds overnight in tepid water to help speed up&nbsp;germination.</li><li>If you are planting okra transplants, be sure to space them 1 to 2 feet apart to give them ample room to&nbsp;grow.</li><li>Okra plants are tall, so&nbsp;space out the rows 3 to 4 feet&nbsp;apart.</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Eliminate weeds when the plants are young, then mulch heavily—4 to 8 inches—to prevent more&nbsp;weeds.</li><li>During the growing season, <a href=\"https://agrilifeextension.tamu.edu/library/gardening/okra/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Masabni of Texas <span class=\"caps\">A&amp;M</span></a> recommends that you “cultivate around the okra plants to remove weeds and grass. To avoid damaging the okra roots, pull weeds close to the plants by&nbsp;hand.”</li><li>Side-dress the plants with 10-10-10, aged manure, or rich compost (1/2 pound per 25 feet of row). You could also apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly. Avoid too much nitrogen, which deters flowering and encourages leafy growth.

One inch of water per week is ideal, but use more if you are in a hot, arid&nbsp;region.</li><li>High heat can slow the growth of&nbsp;okra.</li><li>Prune the tops of okra plants when they reach 5 to 6 feet tall. This will result in more side branches. Prune those as&nbsp;needed.</li><li>In warm regions, some growers cut plants to about 2 feet when productivity slows in summer.

In general, okra is ready to harvest in about 60 to 70 days. You want to look for pods about 2 to 4 inches long (about 3 to 6 days after flowering). Much bigger, and the okra can become tough and stringy. (Round-podded varieties may remain tender at larger sizes.) Wear gloves and long sleeves, as okra has tiny spines that can irritate the skin. Use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut the pod off the stem, leaving about 1/4 inch of stem on the pod; handle pods carefully, as they are easily bruised. Keep harvesting at least every other day to encourage more pods to form. If a pod gets too big, remove it from the plant and discard (or use it in flower arrangements); leaving it on the plant may slow the development of other pods.&nbsp;</p><p>When buying okra at a store, look for bright green, firm (but not hard) pods that are a maximum of 4 inches long. Avoid any that are limp/soft, dried, dull in color, or moldy.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-132836\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"131067\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Brent Murray&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Mon, 08/28/2023 - 08:27</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"131067\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90089\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      Your “cooking tips” failed to mention air frying which has become our favorite way of preparing.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-131067\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"131071\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  \n            <div class=\"field field--name-user-picture field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">  <a href=\"/author/editors\" hreflang=\"en\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/pictures/picture-343787-1548684969.jpg?itok=sYwPCglb\" width=\"82\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Profile picture for user The Editors\" class=\"image-style-thumbnail\" />\n\n</a>\n</div>\n      </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;a title=&quot;View user profile.&quot; href=&quot;/author/editors&quot;&gt;The Editors&lt;/a&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Mon, 08/28/2023 - 10:48</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"131071\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90089\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      <p>Thanks for adding this in!

Many years ago, my Mom and I, both adventurous Foodies, tried Bird's Eye \"Whole Frozen Baby Okra\", never having had Okra before, and marveling at the cute little pods and lovely cross section. We steamed it, according to the package instructions, and added it to our lunch plates. We were immediately assaulted by the sn*t factor, and in unison, consigned it to the compost pile.  MANY years later, still adventurous, I have continued to try it prepared in different ways. \r\nFinally, in different recipes, including deep fried, and stir fried as in Indian stir fries, I have finally come to appreciate it.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-137834\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n
