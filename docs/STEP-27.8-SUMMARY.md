## Features

### 🌱 Crop Display
- Shows up to **3 active crops** per grow area
- **Green badge** with plant names
- **"+X more"** indicator for areas with many crops

### 🎨 Color Coding
- **White** = Active crops (PLANTED, GROWING)
- **Yellow** = Harvested crops
- **Red** = Diseased or failed crops

### 🧠 Smart Filtering
- Only shows **active crops** (filters out harvested)
- Auto-fetches when you load the garden
- Graceful error handling

### 📐 Clean Design
- Centers below grow area name
- Works for rectangles AND circles (buckets)
- Hides when you select/resize (stays out of the way)
- Replaces dimensions text when crops are shown

## Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
1. `lib/api.ts` - Added `currentCrops` to GrowArea type
2. `page.tsx` - Fetches crops when loading garden
3. `GrowAreaBox.tsx` - Renders crop display

**Performance:**
- Parallel crop fetching (fast)
- Minimal overhead
- Scales to many grow areas

## Try It Out

1. **Create some crops** in your grow areas
2. **Switch to board view**
3. **See your plants** displayed right on the boxes!

**Test Scenarios:**
- Add 1-2 crops → See them listed
- Add 5+ crops → See "+X more" indicator
- Mark a crop HARVESTED → It disappears from board
- Mark a crop DISEASED → It shows in red
