  "plantingGuide" : "### Grow crisp, flavorful celery with this guide to planting, care, and harvest\n\n\n### Planting\nSelect a planting site that receives full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day). Celery needs nutrient-rich soil. Loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches with a garden fork or tiller, then mix 2 to 4 inches of aged manure and/or compost into the soil, or work in some 5-10-10 fertilizer. Celery prefers soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8. Get a soil test if you’re not sure of your soil pH. It’s important for celery to grow in moisture-retentive soil that doesn’t drain too quickly. Wild celery grows in boggy ground, so you’ll need to ensure consistent moisture for this thirsty vegetable, while a sunny spot should ensure good, even growth. When to Plant Celery Due to its need for a long growing season, it’s best to start celery seed indoors. For a spring crop, start seeds 10 to 12 weeks before your last spring frost date. For a fall crop, start seeds in time to transplant seedlings 10 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost date. How to Plant Celery Starting Seeds Before sowing, soak seeds in warm water overnight. This will speed germination. The seeds are tiny, so handle them with care and a keen eye! Fill seed flats or pots with good-quality seed-starting mix, then gently firm it level. Press soaked seeds into seed-starting soil; to get good germination, do not cover with soil. The easiest way to sow the seeds is to carefully tap the packet above the surface of the potting mix and watch carefully as the seeds fall. Ideally, you want them to fall about an inch apart. Once you’re done, firm the seeds into place. Cover starter trays/pots with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Germination should occur in about a week, but it can take up to 3 weeks; be patient. Soon after seedlings appear, place a fluorescent grow light 3 inches above them for 16 hours a day (plants need dark hours, too). Maintain an ambient temperature of 70° to 75°F (21° to 24°C) during the day and 60° to 65°F (15° to 18°C) at night. Mist regularly. When seedlings are 2 inches tall, transplant them to individual peat pots or to deeper flats with new potting soil. In flats, set the plants at least 2 inches apart. Harden off seedlings before transplanting by reducing water slightly and putting them outdoors (in a sheltered spot protected from the sun) for a couple of hours each day. Transplanting Outdoors Plant celery outdoors when the soil temperature reaches at least 50°F (10°C) and nighttime temperatures don’t dip down below 40°F (4°C). (Cold weather after planting can cause bolting.) Plant seedlings 8 to 10 inches apart. Water thoroughly.\n\n### When to Plant Celery\n- Due to its need for a long growing season, it’s best to start celery seed indoors.

  "careInstructions" : "### Grow crisp, flavorful celery with this guide to planting, care, and harvest\n\n\n### Growing\nTo grow well, celery has three critical needs: Cool weather; celery won’t tolerate high temperatures. Constant water; stalks will be small, stringy, tough, and/or hollow if it goes without water. Soil that’s rich in organic matter and—because its roots are shallow (just a few inches deep)—fertilizer applied on top of the soil. Make sure to provide plenty of water during the entire growing season, especially during hot, dry weather. Use row covers for the first 4 to 5 weeks in order to protect from pests. When plants are 6 inches tall, mulch around them to keep the soil moist and roots cool. Side-dress with compost. Comfrey pellets are great, as are coffee grounds, tickled into the soil between plants. In the second and third months of growth, side-dress with 1 tablespoon of a 5-10-10 fertilizer 3 to 4 inches from each plant. Keep celery weed-free, but be careful when weeding, as celery has shallow roots that could easily get disturbed. Tie growing celery stalks together to keep them from sprawling. Start earthing up trenching varieties once the stems reach about a foot tall, banking the soil up by about 3 inches (8cm) each time until you can hill up no more. Blanch (wrap or cover) stalks to eliminate any bitter taste and produce pale green stalks. Use anything that will keep out light: brown bag paper or cardboard (secure with old nylon stockings, string, vegetable wires), half-gallon milk cartons (cut-out tops and bottoms), or the like. Do not cover the celery’s leaves. Photo credit: Yuris/Shutterstock.\n\n### Growing Asian Greens: Bok Choy, Tatsoi, Mizuna, and More for Your Fall Garden\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Grow crisp, flavorful celery with this guide to planting, care, and harvest\n\n\n### Harvesting\nHarvest celery from summer through the autumn until the first hard frosts stop growth. As a biennial, celery may overwinter in milder climates, producing occasional stems throughout the coldest months and picking up again in spring before finally stretching to flower. You can harvest plants whole, but cutting or picking individual stems as required will keep plants producing over a longer period. The parts of celery that are harvested are mainly the stalks, which are above ground. Pick the stalks whenever you want. Young celery is as good as the mature product. Harvest stalks from the outside in. You may begin harvesting when stalks are about 8 inches tall. Celery can be kept in the garden for up to a month if the soil is built up around it to maintain an ideal temperature. Celery will tolerate a light frost, but not consecutive frosts. Tip: The darker the stalks become, the more nutrients they will contain. Texture changes with color; dark green stalks will be tougher. How to Store Celery Keep celery in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Celery stores really well; you can keep it for many weeks with no trouble. Celery stalks can be frozen. Cut the stalks into half-inch pieces and store them in freezer-grade bags.",
  "pestsAndDiseases" : "### Pests/Diseases\nCelery is relatively trouble-free. To control pests early on, cover the plants with garden fabric (row covers) during the first 4 to 6 weeks of the growing season Celery Pests and Diseases Pest/Disease Type Symptoms Control/Prevention Carrot rust flies Insect Wilted/stunted plants; tunnels with rust-color excrement in roots of carrot-family crops; root rot Monitor adults with yellow sticky traps; use row covers; add native plants to invite beneficial insects; destroy crop residue; rotate crops Cucumber mosaic virus Virus Varies, but may include stunting, mottled green/yellow/white pattern or ringed spots on leaves; distorted leaf growth Destroy infected plants; choose resistant varieties and certified virus-free seed; use row covers; disinfect tools; weed; control aphids (virus carriers); use mulch Earwigs Insect Many small holes in leaves/stalks Trap in tuna can filled with 1/2 inch of fish oil and sunk in soil such that edge is slightly above ground level; remove plant debris and other nearby hiding places Flea beetles Insect Numerous tiny holes in leaves (looks like leaves were hit by a shotgun) Use row covers; mulch heavily; add native plants to invite beneficial insects Slugs/snails Mollusk Irregular holes in leaves; slimy secretion on plants/soil; seedlings “disappear” Handpick; avoid thick bark mulch; use copper plant collars; avoid overhead watering; lay boards on soil in evening, and in morning dispose of “hiding” pests in hot, soapy water; drown in deep container filled with 1/2 inch of beer, or sugar water and yeast, and sunk so that top edge is slightly above ground; apply 1-inch-wide strip of food-grade diatomaceous earth as barrier",

\n        <p>Celery might have a reputation for being a diva in the garden, but with a little patience and know-how, you’ll be harvesting crisp, flavorful stalks that grocery store bunches can only dream of. Whether you’re adding crunch to your soups or flavor to your stews, growing celery at home is totally worth it. We’ll walk you through everything you need to know—from seed to soup&nbsp;spoon!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Celery</h2><p>Celery needs a long, relatively cool growing season to grow nice and tall 12- to 18-inch stalks, requiring up to 140 days to come to harvest; however, some short-season varieties are available. In cooler regions, it does best planted in the early spring. In warmer areas, plan to plant in mid- to late&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Although celery has a reputation for being fussy to grow at home, celery always has a place in our gardens because it&#8217;s so useful in the kitchen—for stews, stir-fries, soups, and salads. Celery is&nbsp;considered a hardy biennial, but it&#8217;s typically grown as an annual. It&#8217;s best to start celery from seed indoors (transplants are hard to find and do not always succeed), and the plant is prone to bolting in cold weather, so it requires a little extra care, but you can succeed armed with this&nbsp;knowledge!</p><p>There are two main types of celery&nbsp;available:</p><ol><li><strong>Trenching celery</strong> needs soil mounded up against the stems as they grow to produce crisp, pale stems. To make this easier, trenching celery is typically planted into trenches, hence the name, but some gardeners aid this blanching process using cardboard tubes, pipes, or&nbsp;collars.</li><li><strong>Self-blanching celery</strong>&nbsp;requires none of these extra steps. This makes it much easier to grow, and the stems are just as&nbsp;tasty!</li></ol><p>Enjoy our video all about growing celery, and then follow the planting, growing, and harvesting instructions&nbsp;below.</p><div class=\"youtube-container\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6572Sp7Yd4\" width=\"720\"></iframe></div></p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-fa3d3a2794e5ae4794156ec76d8cbd004b1d6790ca09da7c98a11e433d8ef7cb\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/best-vegetables-cool-weather\" hreflang=\"und\">Early Spring Vegetables to Plant</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/grow-your-own-salads-indoors-all-winter\" hreflang=\"und\">Grow Your Own Salads Indoors All Winter</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/types-asian-greens-fast-growers-fall\" hreflang=\"und\">Growing Asian Greens: Bok Choy, Tatsoi, Mizuna, and More for Your Fall Garden</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n        <p>Select a planting site that receives full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day). Celery needs nutrient-rich soil.&nbsp;Loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches with a garden fork or tiller, then mix 2 to 4 inches of aged manure and/or compost into the soil, or work in some 5-10-10 fertilizer.&nbsp;Celery prefers soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.8. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/3-simple-diy-soil-tests\">Get a soil test</a> if you&#8217;re not sure of your soil&nbsp;pH.</p><p>It&#8217;s important for celery to grow in&nbsp;moisture-retentive soil that doesn&#8217;t drain too quickly. Wild celery grows in boggy ground, so you’ll need to ensure consistent moisture for this thirsty vegetable, while a sunny spot should ensure good, even&nbsp;growth.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Celery</h3><ul><li>Due to its need for a long growing season, it&#8217;s best to start celery seed indoors.<ul><li>For a <strong>spring crop</strong>, start seeds 10 to 12 weeks before your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">last&nbsp;spring frost date</a>.</li><li>For a <strong>fall crop</strong>, start seeds in time to transplant seedlings 10 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost&nbsp;date.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Celery</h3><p><strong>Starting&nbsp;Seeds</strong></p><ul><li>Before sowing, soak seeds in warm water overnight. This will speed germination.&nbsp;The seeds are tiny, so handle them with care and a keen&nbsp;eye!</li><li>Fill seed flats or pots with&nbsp;good-quality seed-starting mix, then gently firm it&nbsp;level.</li><li>Press soaked seeds into seed-starting soil; to get good germination, do not cover with soil. The easiest way to sow the seeds is to carefully tap the packet above the surface of the potting mix and watch carefully as the seeds fall. Ideally, you want them to fall about an inch&nbsp;apart. Once you’re done, firm the seeds into&nbsp;place.</li><li>Cover starter trays/pots with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Germination should occur in about a week, but it can take up to 3 weeks;&nbsp;be&nbsp;patient.</li><li>Soon after seedlings appear, place a fluorescent grow light 3 inches above them for 16 hours a day (plants need dark hours,&nbsp;too).</li><li>Maintain an ambient temperature of 70° to&nbsp;75°F (21° to 24°C) during the day and 60° to 65°F (15° to 18°C) at&nbsp;night.</li><li>Mist&nbsp;regularly.</li><li>When seedlings are 2 inches tall, transplant them to individual peat pots or to deeper flats with new potting soil. In flats, set the plants at least 2 inches&nbsp;apart.</li><li>Harden off seedlings before <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/tips-transplanting-seedlings\">transplanting</a> by reducing water slightly and putting them outdoors (in a sheltered spot protected from the sun) for a couple of hours each&nbsp;day.</li></ul><p><strong>Transplanting&nbsp;Outdoors</strong></p><ul><li>Plant celery outdoors when the soil temperature reaches at least 50°F (10°C) and nighttime temperatures don&#8217;t dip down below 40°F (4°C). (Cold weather after planting can cause&nbsp;bolting.)</li><li>Plant seedlings 8 to 10 inches&nbsp;apart.</li><li>Water&nbsp;thoroughly.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <p>To grow well, celery has three critical&nbsp;needs:</p><ol><li><strong>Cool weather</strong>; celery won’t tolerate high&nbsp;temperatures.</li><li><strong>Constant water</strong>; stalks will be small, stringy, tough, and/or hollow if it goes without&nbsp;water.</li><li><strong>Soil that’s rich in organic matter</strong> and—because its roots are shallow (just a few inches deep)—fertilizer applied on top of the&nbsp;soil.</li></ol><ul><li>Make sure to provide plenty of water during the entire growing season, especially during hot, dry&nbsp;weather.</li><li>Use row covers for the first 4 to 5 weeks in order to protect from&nbsp;pests.</li><li>When plants are 6 inches tall, mulch around them to keep the soil moist and roots&nbsp;cool.</li><li>Side-dress with <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/how-compost-guide-composting-home\">compost</a>.&nbsp;Comfrey pellets are great, as are coffee grounds, tickled into the soil between&nbsp;plants.</li><li>In the second and third months of growth, side-dress&nbsp;with 1 tablespoon of a 5-10-10 fertilizer 3 to 4 inches from each&nbsp;plant.</li><li>Keep celery weed-free, but be careful when weeding, as celery has shallow roots that could easily get&nbsp;disturbed.</li><li>Tie growing celery stalks together to keep them from&nbsp;sprawling.</li><li>Start earthing up trenching varieties once the stems reach about a foot&nbsp;tall, banking the soil up by about 3 inches (8cm) each time until you can hill up no&nbsp;more.</li><li>Blanch (wrap or cover) stalks to eliminate any bitter taste and produce pale green stalks. Use anything that will keep out light: brown bag paper or cardboard (secure with old nylon stockings, string, vegetable wires), half-gallon milk cartons (cut-out tops and bottoms), or the like. Do not cover the celery’s&nbsp;leaves.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"celery growing in the garden\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/celery-shutterstock_262679072_full_width.jpg\" style=\"height:478px;\" width=\"720\">\n<figcaption><em>Photo credit: Yuris/Shutterstock</em>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li><strong>‘Afina’&nbsp;</strong>produces tall, slender stalks (up to 30 inches in height) and is a dark green, hardy, quick-growing variety (60 days to&nbsp;maturity).</li><li><strong>‘Conquistador&#8217;</strong>&nbsp;is tolerant of higher temps, water shortages, and average soil&nbsp;fertility.</li><li><strong>‘Golden Self Blanching&#8217;</strong> is an heirloom dwarf with stringless stalks.
