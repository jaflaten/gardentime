Loose beds rich in organic matter and full sun are the recipe for growing shallots. They will grow, albeit a little slower and smaller, in partial sun and prefer slightly moist soil, but not wet. Shallots still need good drainage to prevent root rot. Shallots can be grown in containers as well. Choose a larger container at least 10 inches deep. You’ll need to closely monitor the soil moisture level—don’t let them dry out. When to Plant Shallots Shallot bulbs can be planted in the late fall or early spring. Only where winters are extreme should a fall planting be avoided. Fall planting works for gardens in USDA Hardiness Zones 5 to 8. If it is any colder, your sets will probably not survive; you will need to plant them in the spring instead. By planting in the spring, you will still get shallots, but they will be smaller and not quite as flavorful as the fall-planted ones. In warm gardens further south, they will not get the day length they need to produce big bulbs unless you can find short day shallots, which will start producing bulbs with only 10 to 12 hours of daylight. It’s recommended that gardeners in Zones 9 to 11 grow multiplier or potato onions instead. They are very similar to shallots, producing clusters of onions from a single planted clove, and are good for hot climates. In the early spring, plant sets or sow seeds from 2 to 4 weeks before your average last spring frost date. If growing from seed, start shallot seeds indoors about 8 to 10 weeks prior to your last frost date so they’re ready to transplant in spring. In the fall, plant about the same time as garlic. When to plant varies, but generally, bulbs can be planted a week or two after your first fall frost date. They mature in 100 to 120 days after planting, depending on variety. A late fall planting is ready in early summer. An early spring planting is ready in late summer. How to Plant Shallots Planting shallot bulbs is easy and quick. If your soil is soft, they can be poked in instead of digging a trench or hole. To plant shallot cloves: Work the soil with a garden fork to about 6 inches deep and mix in an inch-thick layer of compost. Separate shallot bulbs into individual cloves. Plant each clove roots-down and top-up, about 6 inches apart in rows 1 foot apart. The top of the clove should show above the soil if planting in spring. If planting in fall, bury the clove one shallot deep. Water and mulch. A light covering of straw mulch will hide the bulbs from birds and squirrels without hindering sprouting. Tip: Shallots planted in the fall need a deep mulch covering—about 4 inches worth. Remove some of the mulch after the snow melts to help the sprouts find the light in spring. Over the winter, mulch can pack down. A thick, dense, wet layer can be difficult for new shallots to poke through. Leave just enough for weed control. Shallots growing in soil. Credit: S.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Shallots\n\n\n### Growing\nShallots are easy to grow but don’t like to get dry, and they don’t do well with competition from weeds. Mulching shallots is the key to keeping soil moisture levels even. Check the soil moisture by working your finger 2 to 3 inches deep. The soil should be cool and a little damp. Mulch will also keep the weeds down. Check your rain gauge and provide extra water if needed. Shallots like about an inch of water per week, more in hot or dry weather. Hand-pull weeds near the base of the plant. Don’t hoe or use a tined cultivator.\n\n### How to Grow Leeks: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Guide\n\n\n### How to Grow Salsify: Planting & Care Guide for This Unique Root Vegetable\n\n\n### How to Grow Honeydew Melons: Planting, Growing, and Care Tips\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Shallots\n\n\n### Harvesting\nShallots are ready to harvest when most of the tops have bent over and started to die back. Gently pull shallots from the ground (ideally, using a garden fork) and lay them out in a sunny spot to dry for several days. Brush off excess soil and bring them inside to a dry location to finish drying. When ready for storage, the tops should be thoroughly dried and brown. Either braid the tops like garlic or cut the tops off about 2 inches above the bulb. Store in a cool, dry, dark place (not the fridge) for winter. Use the thick-necked ones first, since they will not store well. Be sure to save the biggest and best cloves to replant in the fall. Like garlic, they will adapt to your growing conditions over the years and give you great harvests each summer. One pound of sets should give you 40 to 50 cloves to plant. They are pricey, but as long as you save some to replant, you will never have to buy them again!

Are they wee little onions? Funny-looking garlic? Neither! Shallots are prized in the kitchen for their mild flavor and smooth texture. Learn how to plant shallots (in late fall or early spring) with our growing&nbsp;guide.</p><h2>About&nbsp;Shallots</h2><p>Shallots are members of the <em>Allium</em> genus, just like onions, leeks, and garlic. The bulbs grow in a manner more similar to onions but look closer to garlic, growing in&nbsp;clusters.</p><p>Small in size with papery, copper-pink skin, shallots are a staple for your kitchen and a tasty addition to many dishes. Shallots break down and caramelize more easily than onions, producing smoother textures and more velvety&nbsp;sauces.</p><p>Learning to grow shallots expands your options from the typical sparse selection in the grocery store, and they’ll keep for months. There are three main varieties of shallots: French gray, Jersey (sometimes called pink), and Echalion. Of course, you’ll also find yellow shallots, banana shallots, and many&nbsp;others.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yd_l86cScVs?si=2BxkD0km2zqBv2ig\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><h3>How Shallots&nbsp;Grow</h3><p>A biennial, shallots will make a bulb one year, then flower and seed the next. While most gardeners grow them from sets, similar to onions, they also grow from seed. Shallots grown from sets usually produce between four and 12 new bulbs, while those grown from seed often produce only one. However, many varieties are available that will produce one larger shallot bulb instead of several small ones, which can be easier to use in the kitchen.<br><br>Shallots, like onions, are day-length sensitive. They grow best in areas suitable for growing long-day onions, generally in the northern half of the country. Gardeners in the South may find trouble getting them to bulb when grown from sets. Breeders have developed day-neutral shallots, which are worth looking into for gardeners in the country’s southern&nbsp;half.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-b5b06a3784a90c65d0ee6708c66512a1c47fc2d88eb2376a7c3cff171527cefa\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/leeks\" hreflang=\"en\">How to Grow Leeks: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Guide</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/yellow-watermelons\" hreflang=\"en\">What Is A Yellow Watermelon?

Loose beds rich in organic matter and full sun are the recipe for growing shallots. They will grow, albeit a little slower and smaller, in partial sun and prefer slightly moist soil, but not wet. Shallots still need good drainage to prevent root&nbsp;rot.&nbsp;</p><p>Shallots can be grown in containers as well. Choose a larger container at least 10 inches deep. You’ll need to closely monitor the soil moisture level—don’t let them dry&nbsp;out.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Shallots</h3><p>Shallot bulbs can be planted in the late fall or early spring. Only where winters are extreme should a fall planting be avoided. Fall planting works for gardens in <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/what-are-plant-hardiness-zones\"><span class=\"caps\">USDA</span> Hardiness Zones 5 to 8</a>. If it is any colder, your sets will probably not survive; you will need to plant them in the spring instead. By planting in the spring, you will still get shallots, but they will be smaller and not quite as flavorful as the fall-planted ones. In warm gardens further south, they will not get the day length they need to produce big bulbs unless you can find short day shallots, which will start producing bulbs with only 10 to 12 hours of&nbsp;daylight.</p><p>It’s recommended that gardeners in Zones 9 to 11 grow multiplier or potato onions instead. They are very similar to shallots, producing clusters of onions from a single planted clove, and are good for hot&nbsp;climates.</p><p>In the early spring, plant sets or sow seeds from 2 to 4 weeks before your average last spring frost&nbsp;date.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If growing from seed, start shallot seeds indoors about 8 to 10 weeks prior to your last frost date so they’re ready to transplant in&nbsp;spring.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/planting-garlic-fall\">n the fall, plant about the same time as garlic</a>. When to plant varies, but generally, bulbs can be planted a week or two after your first fall frost&nbsp;date.</p><p>They mature in 100 to 120 days after planting, depending on variety. A late fall planting is ready in early summer. An early spring planting is ready in late&nbsp;summer.</p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Shallots</h3><p>Planting shallot bulbs is easy and quick. If your soil is soft, they can be poked in instead of digging a trench or&nbsp;hole.</p><p><strong>To plant shallot&nbsp;cloves:</strong></p><ul><li>Work the soil with a garden fork to about 6 inches deep and mix in an inch-thick layer of compost.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Separate shallot bulbs into individual cloves.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Plant each clove roots-down and top-up, about 6 inches apart in rows 1 foot apart. The top of the clove should show above the soil if planting in spring. If planting in fall, bury the clove one shallot deep.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Water and mulch. A light covering of straw mulch will hide the bulbs from birds and squirrels without hindering&nbsp;sprouting.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Tip: </strong>Shallots planted in the fall need a deep mulch covering—about 4 inches worth. Remove some of the mulch after the snow melts to help the sprouts find the light in spring. Over the winter, mulch can pack down. A thick, dense, wet layer can be difficult for new shallots to poke through. Leave just enough for weed&nbsp;control.&nbsp;</p><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"shallots growing in soil\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9e6ca953-4ba8-423c-8146-022688f8ff0d\" height=\"1329\" src=\"https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/images/shallot-growing-shutterstock_1007243677.jpg\" width=\"2048\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Shallots growing in soil.
