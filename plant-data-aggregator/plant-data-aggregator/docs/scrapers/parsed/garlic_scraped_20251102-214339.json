  "plantingGuide" : "### Easy garlic growing tips—from choosing varieties to planting cloves and harvesting tasty bulbs\n\n\n### Planting Garlic—From a Clove\nYes, garlic is planted from a single clove, often from the past season’s garlic harvest! Each clove will grow into a new bulb.\nWhile garlic can be planted in early spring, however, it’s more common to plant in late fall after a hard frost to give garlic plants a head start on spring growth. Why? Garlic needs a cold period to grow—about ten weeks before 45°F (or 8°C). If you live in a warmer climate, you can also put the garlic in a paper bag in the back of the fridge for 10 weeks to mimic the outdoors.\nThe bulbs are generally ready to harvest the following summer. But you can also enjoy the garlic leaves or “scapes,” which appear in early spring. They’re delicious stir-fried or in salads.\nIn addition to its intense flavor and many culinary uses, the “stinking rose” also serves as an insect repellent in the garden and has been used as a home remedy for centuries.\n\n### Planting\nGarlic thrives in full sun, so select a planting site that receives 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. Feed the soil with compost or aged manure. For bigger bulbs, we also love to add an organic amendment such as bonemeal or a higher-potassium fertilizer. It’s very important that garlic doesn’t sit in wet soil. If your garden soil is high in clay or drains poorly, garlic grower Robin Jarry of Hope, Maine, suggests growing in heavily mulched raised beds instead. “I plant in raised beds for good drainage and then mulch with about 6 inches of old hay after the ground freezes. I never water my garlic—I like low-maintenance vegetables!” Raised beds should be 2 to 3 feet wide and at least 10 to 12 inches deep. When to Plant Garlic Probably the most important factor in growing bigger bulbs is when you plant. Plant cloves in the late fall, about one or two weeks after the first killing frost. See timing in the chart below. Garlic does best if it can experience a “dormancy” period of colder weather—at least 40˚F (4°C)—that lasts 4 to 8 weeks. When planted in the fall, garlic bulbs have time to develop healthy roots before temperatures drop and/or the ground freezes, but not enough time for the garlic to form top growth. Then, by early spring, the bulbs “wake up” from their dormancy and start rapidly producing foliage, followed by bulbs, before the harshest heat of summer stops their growth. You can plant garlic cloves in mild climates as late as February or March, but the resulting bulbs won’t be as large. However, you can still enjoy the garlic scapes during the summer. (Scapes are the plant’s tender green shoots with a mild garlic flavor. Enjoy on eggs, in salads, as a pizza topping, or in stir-fries!) If you plant in the spring, wait until after the soil can be worked, and it crumbles apart easily. Hardiness Zone When to Plant Garlic Zones 1 to 6 Early October Zones 7 and 8 Late October to November Zones 9 and 10 November to Early December Zones 10+ Put Cloves in Fridge for 10 Weeks Before Planting How to Plant Garlic Immediately before planting, work a couple of tablespoons of 5-10-10 complete fertilizer, bonemeal, or fish meal into the soil several inches below where the base of the garlic cloves will rest. Select large, healthy cloves that are free of disease. The larger the clove, the bigger and healthier the bulb you will get the following summer. Don’t break apart until one or two days before planting—crack open on the day of planting whenever possible. As soon as the cloves are separated from the root plate, they begin to deteriorate. We keep the husks on; some gardeners take the husks off, but we haven’t seen that it matters too much. Plant cloves 4 to 8 inches apart and 2 inches deep in their upright position (with the wider root side facing down and the pointed end facing up). Plant in rows spaced 6 to 12 inches apart. Depending on the variety, a 10-foot row should yield about 5 pounds of the fragrant bulbs. Planting garlic clove by clove.

  "careInstructions" : "### Easy garlic growing tips—from choosing varieties to planting cloves and harvesting tasty bulbs\n\n\n### Growing\nGardeners in areas where the ground freezes should mulch garlic beds heavily with straw or leaves to ensure proper overwintering. Read our mulching guide for more info! Mulch should be removed in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. (Young shoots can’t survive in temps below 20°F/-6°C on their own. Keep them under cover.) In the spring, as warmer temperatures arrive, shoots will emerge through the ground. Cut off any flower shoots that emerge in spring. These may decrease bulb size. Garlic is a heavy feeder. In early spring, side-dress with or broadcast blood meal, pelleted chicken manure, or a synthetic source of nitrogen such as a pelleted fertilizer. Fertilize again just before the bulbs begin to swell in response to lengthening daylight (usually early May in most regions). Repeat if the foliage begins to turn yellow. Keep the planting site well weeded. Garlic doesn’t do well with competition—it needs all available nutrients! Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing (mid-May through June). If May and June are very dry, irrigate to a depth of 2 feet every eight to 10 days. As mid-June approaches, taper off watering. Photo by YuriyS/Getty Images",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Easy garlic growing tips—from choosing varieties to planting cloves and harvesting tasty bulbs\n\n\n### Harvesting\nHarvest from fall plantings will range from late June to August. If you planted in the spring, calculate your approximate harvest date based on the “days to maturity” of the garlic variety you planted. In general, the clue is to look for yellowing foliage, but this isn’t the case for all garlic varieties. Harvest when the tops begin to yellow and fall over, but before they are completely dry. Before digging up your whole crop, it’s a good idea to sample one bulb. Lift a bulb to see if the crop is ready. We often dig up a bulb before the tops are completely yellow (in late June or early July), as some garlic types will be ready earlier. The garlic head will be divided into plump cloves, and the skin covering the outside of the bulbs will be thick, dry, and papery. If pulled too early, the bulb wrapping will be thin and easily disintegrate. If left in the ground too long, the bulbs sometimes split apart. The skin may also split, which exposes the bulbs to disease and will affect their longevity in storage. To harvest, carefully dig (don’t pull or yank stems by hand) up the bulbs using a garden fork. Avoid damaging the roots, especially the root plate (where they attach to the bulb). Lift the plants and carefully brush off surplus soil, but do not remove any foliage or roots before putting them to dry thoroughly. Photo by Nikolaeva Elena/Getty Images How to Store Garlic Let garlic cure in an airy, shady, dry spot for about 2 weeks. Hang them upside down on a string in bunches of 4 to 6, or leave them to try on a homemade rack made from chicken wire stretched over posts. Make sure all sides get good air circulation. After a few weeks, the garlic should be totally dry and ready to store. The bulbs are cured and ready to store when the wrappers are dry and papery, and the roots are dry. The root crown should be hard, and the cloves can be cracked apart easily. Once the garlic bulbs are dry, you can store them. Brush off (do not wash) dirt, remove only the dirtiest wrappers, trim roots to ¼ inch, and cut tops to 1 to 2 inches. Bulbs should be stored in a cool (55°F / 13°C), dark, dry place, and can be kept in the same way for several months. Don’t store in your basement if it’s humid. Do not store garlic in the refrigerator, either, as it will be too cold and too humid. The flavor will increase as the bulbs are dried. Properly stored, garlic should last until the next crop is harvested the following summer. If you plan on planting garlic again next season, save some of your largest, best-formed bulbs to plant again in the fall.\n\n### When to Harvest Garlic (Plus: How to Cure for Storage)\n",
  "pestsAndDiseases" : "### Pests/Diseases\nGarlic has very few problems with pests in the garden (in fact, it’s a natural pest repellent), and very few problems with the diseases that plague other veggies.

garlic clove—could grow into a powerhouse bulb packed with flavor? Growing garlic is fun, simple, and a little magical. Plant your cloves in fall, and by summer, you’ll be harvesting your own fresh “stinking rose” to spice up any dish. Learn all about planting, growing, and harvesting garlic and garlic&nbsp;scapes.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><em>A nickel will get you on the subway, but garlic will get you a seat.</em><br>–Yiddish&nbsp;proverb</p><h2>Planting Garlic—From a&nbsp;Clove</h2><p>Yes, garlic is planted from a single clove, often from the past season&#8217;s garlic harvest! Each clove will grow into a new&nbsp;bulb.&nbsp;</p><p>While garlic can be planted in early spring, however, it&#8217;s more common to plant in late fall <a href=\"https://ag.umass.edu/home-lawn-garden/fact-sheets/growing-garlic-getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">after a hard frost to give garlic plants a head start on spring growth</a>. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Why? Garlic needs a cold period to grow—about ten weeks before 45°F (or 8°C). If you live in a warmer climate, you can also put the garlic in a paper bag in the back of the fridge for 10 weeks to mimic the&nbsp;outdoors.</span></p><p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">The bulbs are generally ready to harvest the following summer. But you can also enjoy the </span>garlic leaves or “scapes,” which appear in early spring. They&#8217;re delicious stir-fried or in&nbsp;salads.</p><p>In addition to its intense flavor and many culinary uses, the “stinking rose” also serves as an insect repellent in the garden and has been used as a home remedy for&nbsp;centuries.</p><h3>Can You Plant Store-Bought&nbsp;Garlic?</h3><p>We do not recommend this. Most grocery store garlic heads have been treated. Plus, most commercial garlic comes from large-scale farming areas with mild climates (such as California), so the garlic may not be suited for growing in your climate and may carry pests or diseases with it as&nbsp;well.</p><p>If you want big bulbs, use “seed” garlic from a local nursery, farmer&#8217;s market, or online seed supplier.&nbsp;Or, keep some of your best heads of garlic from your harvest to replant! But before you plant garlic, make sure you know the difference between the&nbsp;two main types of garlic:&nbsp;hardneck and softneck garlic—and which type will grow best in your climate.

For bigger bulbs, we also love to add an organic amendment such as bonemeal or a higher-potassium fertilizer.<br><br>It’s very important that garlic doesn’t sit in wet soil. If your garden soil is high in clay or drains poorly, garlic grower Robin Jarry of Hope, Maine, suggests growing in heavily mulched raised beds instead. “I plant in raised beds for good drainage and then mulch with about 6 inches of old hay after the ground freezes. I never water my garlic—I like low-maintenance&nbsp;vegetables!” Raised beds should be&nbsp;2 to 3 feet wide and at least 10 to 12 inches&nbsp;deep.</p><p><a href=\"https://gardenplanner.almanac.com/\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/Almanac%20Staff/growveg_garlic.jpeg\" alt=\"Spacing for Garlic\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Garlic</h3><p>Probably the most important factor in growing bigger bulbs is when you&nbsp;plant.&nbsp;</p><p>Plant cloves in the late fall, <a href=\"https://extension.umn.edu/vegetables/growing-garlic\" target=\"_blank\">about one or two weeks after the first killing frost</a>. See timing in the chart&nbsp;below.</p><p>Garlic does best if it can experience a “dormancy” period of colder weather—at least 40˚F (4°C)—that lasts 4 to 8 weeks. When planted in the fall, garlic bulbs have time to develop healthy roots before temperatures drop and/or the ground freezes, but not enough time for the garlic to form top growth. Then, by early spring, the bulbs “wake up” from their dormancy and start rapidly producing foliage, followed by bulbs, before the harshest heat of summer stops their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>You can plant garlic cloves in mild climates as late as February or March, but the resulting bulbs won’t be as large. However, you can still enjoy the garlic scapes during the summer. (Scapes are the plant’s tender green shoots with a mild garlic flavor. Enjoy on eggs, in salads, as a pizza topping, or in stir-fries!) If you plant in the spring,&nbsp;wait until after the soil can be worked, and it crumbles apart&nbsp;easily.</p><table class=\"table\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Hardiness Zon</strong>e</th><th><strong>When to Plant Garlic</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zones 1 to 6</td><td>Early October</td></tr><tr><td>Zones 7 and 8</td><td>Late October to November</td></tr><tr><td>Zones 9 and 10</td><td>November to Early December</td></tr><tr><td>Zones 10+</td><td>Put Cloves in Fridge for<br>10 Weeks Before Planting</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Garlic</h3><ul><li>Immediately before planting, work a couple of tablespoons of 5-10-10 complete <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/how-make-organic-plant-fertilizer-home\">fertilizer</a>, bonemeal, or fish meal into the soil several inches below where the base of the garlic cloves will&nbsp;rest.</li><li>Select large, healthy&nbsp;cloves that are free of disease.

Then you need to consider your cooking because different varieties have different taste profiles, from mild to sweet to bold to&nbsp;spicy!</p><h3>Hardneck&nbsp;Garlic</h3><p><strong>Hardnecks&nbsp;</strong>are the best choice for Northern gardeners. This variety is extremely cold hardy for harsh winters. These grow one ring of fat cloves around a hard stem, with fewer but larger cloves per bulb than&nbsp;softnecks.</p><p>Bonus! Hardnecks&nbsp;produce flower stems, aka “scapes,” which must be cut to encourage the bulbs to reach their full potential. The scapes themselves are an early summer treat, delicious if chopped into salads or added to&nbsp;stir-fries.</p><p><strong>Popular hardneck varieties</strong>: ‘Music’ (on the mild side yet rich and mellow); ‘Chesnok Red’ (mild and sweet, creamy texture when roasted); ‘Early Italian’ (sweeter flavor that won&#8217;t overpower dishes); ‘German Red’ (robust, classic garlic flavor which cooks love); ‘Spanish Roja’ (strong and hot, heirloom with classic garlic&nbsp;flavor).</p><h3>Softneck&nbsp;Garlic&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Softnecks</strong>&nbsp;are more common with Southern gardeners, growing well in warm climates with warm winters.&nbsp;They have more intense flavors and tend&nbsp;to grow bigger bulbs with smaller cloves per bulb because energy is not being&nbsp;diverted to top-set bulblets like&nbsp;hardnecks.</p><p>They do not have scapes, but they store better than hardnecks.&nbsp;Like their name suggests, they have necks that stay soft after harvest and, therefore, are the types that you see braided&nbsp;together.</p><p><strong>Popular softneck varieties</strong>: ‘California White Early’&nbsp;(classic moderate garlic flavor, most popular grocery store type, harvest&nbsp;in spring);&nbsp;‘California White Late’ (harvest in summer); ‘Inchelium Red’ (wonderful but mild garlic flavor, superior&nbsp;storage life); ‘Silver White’ (classic garlic, great storage, excellent for beginner);&nbsp;‘Lorz Italian’ (hot and zesty heirloom, popular with&nbsp;cooks).</p><p>Elephant&nbsp;Garlic</p><p><strong>Elephant garlic</strong> isn&#8217;t a true garlic, but it is grown similarly to hardneck varieties, requiring a long, cool growing season&nbsp;in Zones 3 through 9.&nbsp;Most types take about 90 days to harvest once growth starts.&nbsp;Despite its size, it has quite a mild flavor, more similar to&nbsp;onion and shallots than traditional garlic. Bulbs and cloves are large (up to one pound each!), with just a few cloves to a&nbsp;bulb.</p><p><strong>See our complete video that demonstrates how to grow and harvest&nbsp;garlic!</strong></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest block--field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-harvest field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Harvesting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Harvest&nbsp;from fall plantings will range from late June to&nbsp;August.

Harvest when the tops begin to yellow and fall over, but before they are completely&nbsp;dry.</li><li>Before digging up your whole crop, it’s a good idea to sample one bulb. Lift a bulb to see if the crop is ready. We often dig up a bulb before the tops are completely yellow (in late June or early July), as some garlic types will be ready earlier.&nbsp;The garlic head will be divided into plump cloves, and the skin covering the outside of the bulbs will be&nbsp;thick, dry, and papery.<ul><li>If pulled too early, the bulb wrapping will be thin and easily&nbsp;disintegrate.</li><li>If left in the ground too long, the bulbs sometimes split apart. The skin may also split, which exposes the bulbs to disease and will affect their longevity in&nbsp;storage.</li></ul></li><li>To harvest, carefully dig (don’t pull or yank stems by hand) up the bulbs using a garden fork. Avoid damaging the roots, especially the root plate (where they attach to the bulb).&nbsp;Lift the plants and carefully brush off surplus soil, but do not remove any foliage or roots before putting them to&nbsp;dry&nbsp;thoroughly.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"Harvested garlic bulbs.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0330ae03-ae14-4e2d-b6e4-f6cdd9fdeef4\" height=\"100%\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/garlic%20Nikolaeva%20Elena%20GettyImages.jpg\" width=\"100%\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Photo by Nikolaeva Elena/Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How to Store&nbsp;Garlic</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/when-harvest-garlic-plus-how-cure-storage\">Let garlic cure</a> in an airy, shady, dry spot for about 2 weeks. Hang them upside down on a string in bunches of 4 to 6, or leave them to try on a homemade rack made from chicken wire stretched over posts. Make sure all sides get good air&nbsp;circulation.</li><li>After a few weeks, the garlic should be totally dry and ready to&nbsp;store.</li><li>The bulbs are cured and ready to store when the wrappers are dry and papery, and the roots are dry. The root crown should be hard, and the cloves can be cracked apart&nbsp;easily.</li><li>Once the garlic bulbs are dry, you can store them. Brush off (do not wash) dirt, remove only the dirtiest wrappers, trim roots to ¼ inch, and cut tops to 1 to 2&nbsp;inches.</li><li>Bulbs should be stored in a cool (55°F / 13°C), dark, dry place, and can be kept in the same way for several months. Don’t store in your basement if it’s humid. Do not store garlic in the refrigerator, either, as it will be too cold and too&nbsp;humid.</li><li>The flavor will increase as the bulbs are dried. Properly stored, garlic should last until the next crop is harvested the following&nbsp;summer.</li><li>If you plan on planting garlic again next season, save some of your largest, best-formed bulbs to plant again in the&nbsp;fall.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/garlic-dry_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"Garlic cloves in a braid\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n<div class=\"recommender-title block block-block-content block-block-contente8acfdbd-8aa8-4a11-9e44-f56cad64ee7a gardening-recommendations print-no\">\n  \n      <h2 class=\"block__title category-heading\">Gardening Products</h2>\n    \n\n  <div class=\"block__content\">\n    <div class=\"gardening-products-wrapper\">\n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden clearfix text-formatted field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n        <div class=\"recommender-wrapper\" data-ltk-merchandiseblock=\"49397b29-784d-45ad-ba5f-2ca9659c9feb\">\n    <script type=\"text/html\">\n       var linkRoot = \"https://store.almanac.com.com\";\n        <div class=\"prod-rec\" style=\"width: 32%\">\n            <a onclick=\"ga('send', {hitType: 'event', eventCategory: 'Products', eventAction: 'Click', eventLabel: '@Recommendation.Title', transport: 'beacon'});\" href=\"@(linkRoot + Recommendation.LinkUrl)\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <div class=\"rec-image\"><img class=\"prod-image\" src=\"@Recommendation.ImageUrl\" alt=\"View @Recommendation.Title recommended for you\" height=\"250\" /></div>\n                <p class=\"prod-title\">@Recommendation.Title</p>\n                <p>$@Recommendation.Price</p>\n                <p class=\"rec-button\">BUY NOW</p>\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </script>\n</div></p>\n      </div>\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-pests block--field-blocknodeplantfield-pests flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-pests field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Pests/Diseases</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <p>Garlic has very few problems with pests in the garden (in fact, it&#8217;s a natural pest repellent), and very few problems with the diseases that plague other veggies.

I planted both hardneck and softneck garlic in the fall. The hardneck is looking pretty good, with scapes coming up. However, I’m worried about the softneck garlic—the necks are folding and splitting at ground level! I’m most concerned about moisture getting into the bulbs and rotting them from the top. I also have no idea how reliant the bulbs are on the leafy bits to keep growing at the point. Is this normal? If not, is there anything I can do to salvage the softnecks?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-137963\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"137975\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  \n            <div class=\"field field--name-user-picture field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">  <a href=\"/author/catherine-boeckmann\" hreflang=\"en\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/pictures/2024-10/IMG_0365.jpeg?itok=MPOvmTTC\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Profile picture for user Catherine Boeckmann\" class=\"image-style-thumbnail\" />\n\n</a>\n</div>\n      </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;a title=&quot;View user profile.&quot; href=&quot;/author/catherine-boeckmann&quot;&gt;Catherine Boeckmann&lt;/a&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Tue, 06/17/2025 - 09:29</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"137975\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90223\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      <p data-start=\"1904\" data-end=\"1930\">Can you dig up a test bulb? Gently lift a plant and check bulb size. In 6b, softneck can be ready in late June. It's normal for softneck garlic to have their necks fold and split at ground level, especially as they mature and begin to reach the end of its growing cycle. After harvesting, allow the garlic to cure for a couple of weeks. If you think it's splitting early, that's often a sign that it wasn't planted deep enough &nbsp;(at least 3 inches, or 5 inches if not mulching). Minimize late-season irrigation: Reduce or avoid late-season irrigation to allow foliage and necks to dry before harvesting. And be sure the bulbs are well cured!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-137975\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"136132\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Liane&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Tue, 11/05/2024 - 11:41</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"136132\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90223\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      The squirrels ate the greens as soon as they were up.

Just 2 sticky points, though... \r\n1) You state early on (under \"Planting Garlic - From a Clove\") to plant 3 weeks AFTER first frost date, then a bit later (under \"When to Plant Garlic\"), 2) You state in those same sections, respectively, that garlic \"needs a cold period to grow—about ten weeks before 45°F (or 8°C)\" and it \"does best if it can experience a 'dormancy' period of colder weather—at least 40˚F (4°C)—that lasts 4 to 8 weeks.\" I would really appreciate clarification.\r\nIn addition, as a first-time garlic grower, I think I put mine in several weeks late and I am very concerned about getting any harvest at all - I put them on Nov. 1 in Zone 4b (zip code 82834). Have I completely screwed up??? \r\nThanks!!!\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-136112\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"136153\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  \n            <div class=\"field field--name-user-picture field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">  <a href=\"/author/editors\" hreflang=\"en\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/pictures/picture-343787-1548684969.jpg?itok=sYwPCglb\" width=\"82\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Profile picture for user The Editors\" class=\"image-style-thumbnail\" />\n\n</a>\n</div>\n      </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;a title=&quot;View user profile.&quot; href=&quot;/author/editors&quot;&gt;The Editors&lt;/a&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Fri, 11/08/2024 - 17:26</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"136153\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90223\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      <p>Thanks for writing, Kerry, and apologies for the confusion.
