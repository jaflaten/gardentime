# Step 27.7 - Undo/Redo Implementation

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Date:** October 30, 2025

---

## üéØ Objective

Implement undo/redo functionality for the garden canvas to allow users to reverse and reapply actions, improving the editing experience and preventing data loss from accidental changes.

---

## ‚ú® What Was Implemented

### 1. Undo/Redo Hook (`useUndoRedo`)

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`

Created a comprehensive undo/redo system that tracks:

**Supported Actions:**
- `CREATE_OBJECT` - Creating canvas shapes
- `UPDATE_OBJECT` - Updating shape properties (position, size, color, etc.)
- `DELETE_OBJECT` - Deleting shapes
- `MOVE_GROW_AREA` - Moving grow areas
- `RESIZE_GROW_AREA` - Resizing grow areas
- `BATCH_MOVE` - Moving multiple items at once

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum 50 undo steps (configurable)
- ‚úÖ Separate undo and redo stacks
- ‚úÖ Callback-based architecture for flexible action handling
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type safety with union types
- ‚úÖ Automatic state tracking with refs

**API:**
```typescript
const { canUndo, canRedo, undo, redo, recordAction } = useUndoRedo({
  onCreateObject: (object) => { /* recreate object */ },
  onUpdateObject: (id, updates) => { /* apply updates */ },
  onDeleteObject: (id) => { /* delete object */ },
  onMoveGrowArea: (id, x, y) => { /* move grow area */ },
  onResizeGrowArea: (id, width, height) => { /* resize grow area */ },
  onBatchMove: (moves) => { /* move multiple items */ },
});
```

---

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`

Added keyboard shortcuts for undo/redo:

- **Undo:** `Cmd+Z` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux)
- **Redo:** `Cmd+Shift+Z` or `Cmd+Y` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Undo (Cmd/Ctrl + Z)
if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'z' && !e.shiftKey) {
  e.preventDefault();
  onUndo?.();
}

// Redo (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z or Cmd/Ctrl + Y)
if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && (e.shiftKey && e.key === 'z' || e.key === 'y')) {
  e.preventDefault();
  onRedo?.();
}
```

---

### 3. UI Buttons

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/components/DrawingToolbar.tsx`

Added Undo/Redo buttons to the toolbar:

**Visual Design:**
- Located between drawing tools and "Add Grow Area" button
- Disabled state when no actions available
- Tooltip showing keyboard shortcuts
- Arrow icons (‚Ü∂ Undo, ‚Ü∑ Redo)

**Features:**
- Buttons are disabled when no undo/redo actions available
- Visual feedback with gray disabled state
- Hover effects when enabled

---

### 4. Action Recording

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/components/GardenBoardView.tsx`

Integrated action recording throughout the canvas:

**Canvas Object Actions:**
- Creating new shapes (rectangle, circle, line, arrow, text, freehand)
- Moving shapes via drag
- Resizing shapes
- Deleting shapes
- Duplicating shapes

**Grow Area Actions:**
- Moving grow areas
- Resizing grow areas
- Batch moving multiple grow areas

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Before drag
onDragStart={() => {
  dragStartPosRef.current = { id, x, y, isGrowArea };
}}

// After drag
onDragEnd={(x, y) => {
  if (dragStartPosRef.current) {
    recordAction({
      type: 'UPDATE_OBJECT',
      objectId: id,
      before: { x: dragStartPosRef.current.x, y: dragStartPosRef.current.y },
      after: { x, y },
    });
  }
  // ... save to backend
}}
```

---

### 5. Canvas Shape Updates

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/components/CanvasShape.tsx`

Added `onDragStart` callback support:
- Tracks initial position before drag
- Allows GardenBoardView to record "before" state
- Essential for proper undo tracking

---

## üé® User Experience

### Workflow

```
1. User draws a rectangle
   ‚Üì [recordAction: CREATE_OBJECT]
   Undo stack: [Create Rectangle]
   
2. User moves the rectangle
   ‚Üì [recordAction: UPDATE_OBJECT with before/after position]
   Undo stack: [Create Rectangle, Move Rectangle]
   
3. User changes rectangle color
   ‚Üì [recordAction: UPDATE_OBJECT with before/after color]
   Undo stack: [Create Rectangle, Move Rectangle, Change Color]
   
4. User presses Cmd+Z (Undo)
   ‚Üì [Applies "before" color from last action]
   Color reverts, action moves to redo stack
   
5. User presses Cmd+Shift+Z (Redo)
   ‚Üì [Applies "after" color from action]
   Color changes back, action returns to undo stack
```

### Visual Feedback

- **Undo Button:** Disabled (gray) when no actions to undo
- **Redo Button:** Disabled (gray) when no actions to redo
- **Tooltips:** Show keyboard shortcuts on hover
- **Instant Response:** Actions are undone/redone immediately

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Action Type System

```typescript
// Each action type has specific data
type CreateObjectAction = {
  type: 'CREATE_OBJECT';
  object: CanvasObject;  // Full object to recreate
  timestamp: number;
}

type UpdateObjectAction = {
  type: 'UPDATE_OBJECT';
  objectId: number;
  before: Partial<CanvasObject>;  // Previous state
  after: Partial<CanvasObject>;   // New state
  timestamp: number;
}

type DeleteObjectAction = {
  type: 'DELETE_OBJECT';
  object: CanvasObject;  // Full object to restore
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### State Management

**Two Stacks:**
1. **Undo Stack:** Stores actions that can be undone (most recent at end)
2. **Redo Stack:** Stores actions that can be redone (most recent at end)

**Flow:**
- New action ‚Üí Push to undo stack, clear redo stack
- Undo ‚Üí Pop from undo stack, push to redo stack, execute reverse
- Redo ‚Üí Pop from redo stack, push to undo stack, execute forward

**Limits:**
- Maximum 50 actions in undo stack (configurable via `MAX_HISTORY`)
- Oldest actions are removed when limit exceeded
- Redo stack is cleared when new action is performed

---

## üìä Action Coverage

### Fully Supported

‚úÖ **Canvas Objects:**
- Creating shapes (all types)
- Moving shapes (drag)
- Resizing shapes (rectangle, circle)
- Deleting shapes
- Duplicating shapes
- Updating shape properties (color, opacity, stroke, etc.)

‚úÖ **Grow Areas:**
- Moving grow areas (single)
- Moving grow areas (batch/multi-select)
- Resizing grow areas

### Not Yet Supported

‚ùå **Text Editing:**
- Text content changes are not tracked
- Could be added by recording UPDATE_OBJECT on text edit

‚ùå **Point Updates:**
- Line/arrow endpoint adjustments are not tracked
- Would need special handling for points array

‚ùå **Property Panel Changes:**
- Color picker, opacity slider changes are tracked
- But could be optimized to batch rapid changes

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Undo/Redo
**Steps:**
1. Draw a rectangle
2. Move it to a new position
3. Press Cmd+Z (Undo)
4. Press Cmd+Shift+Z (Redo)

**Expected:**
- Undo: Rectangle returns to original position
- Redo: Rectangle moves back to new position
- Buttons enable/disable correctly

---

### Test 2: Multiple Actions
**Steps:**
1. Draw 3 shapes (rectangle, circle, line)
2. Move each shape
3. Change color of rectangle
4. Press Cmd+Z repeatedly

**Expected:**
- Each undo reverses one action in order
- After 7 undos, all shapes are removed
- Undo button disables when stack is empty

---

### Test 3: Delete and Restore
**Steps:**
1. Draw a circle
2. Delete the circle
3. Press Cmd+Z (Undo)

**Expected:**
- Circle reappears in original position
- All properties restored (color, size, etc.)

---

### Test 4: Grow Area Movement
**Steps:**
1. Move a grow area
2. Press Cmd+Z (Undo)

**Expected:**
- Grow area returns to original position
- Works with both single and batch moves

---

### Test 5: Redo Clears on New Action
**Steps:**
1. Draw a shape
2. Move it
3. Press Cmd+Z (Undo)
4. Draw a new shape

**Expected:**
- Redo stack is cleared
- Redo button becomes disabled
- Cannot redo the move anymore

---

### Test 6: Keyboard Shortcuts Don't Interfere
**Steps:**
1. Click in a text input
2. Type some text
3. Press Cmd+Z

**Expected:**
- Text input's native undo works
- Canvas undo doesn't trigger
- No interference with form editing

---

## üéØ Design Decisions

### 1. Callback-Based Architecture

**Choice:** Use callbacks instead of direct state manipulation  
**Reasoning:**
- Parent component controls state
- Hook is reusable in different contexts
- Easier to test independently
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 2. Before/After Tracking

**Choice:** Store both before and after states for updates  
**Reasoning:**
- Makes undo AND redo straightforward
- No need to recompute state
- More reliable than reverse operations
- Slightly more memory, but better UX

### 3. Refs for Position Tracking

**Choice:** Use refs to store drag start position  
**Reasoning:**
- Avoids state updates during drag
- More performant
- Position available when drag ends
- No unnecessary re-renders

### 4. Limited History

**Choice:** Maximum 50 undo steps  
**Reasoning:**
- Prevents unlimited memory growth
- 50 actions is sufficient for most sessions
- Can be increased if needed
- Oldest actions are least likely to be undone

### 5. Clear Redo on New Action

**Choice:** Clear redo stack when new action is performed  
**Reasoning:**
- Standard undo/redo behavior
- Prevents confusing state branches
- Matches user expectations from other apps
- Simpler state management

---

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

### Auto-Save

**Behavior:** Undo/redo triggers auto-save  
**Flow:**
1. User undoes action
2. Canvas object state updates
3. Auto-save hook detects change
4. Debounced save to backend (800ms)

**Note:** This is intentional - undo/redo updates the actual data, not just local UI state.

### Multi-Select

**Behavior:** Batch moves are recorded as single action  
**Example:**
- Select 3 grow areas
- Drag them together
- One BATCH_MOVE action is recorded
- Undo moves all 3 back at once

### Snap-to-Grid

**Behavior:** Snapped positions are recorded  
**Flow:**
1. User drags with snap enabled
2. Position snaps to grid
3. Snapped position is recorded in undo action
4. Undo restores to pre-snap position
