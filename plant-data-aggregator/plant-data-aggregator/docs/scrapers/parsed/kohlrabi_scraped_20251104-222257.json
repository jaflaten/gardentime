  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting\nPlant in a location that receives ample sunlight (at least 6 hours, more is better) and has rich, slightly acidic, well-draining soil. While kohlrabi isn’t a heavy feeder, it is helped by having its soil dressed with 1 inch of compost before planting. Avoid planting kohlrabi where other vegetables in the Brassica family have been grown in the previous 2 or 3 years. This helps to prevent the spread of disease and nutrient deficiencies. When to Plant Kohlrabi Kohlrabi is cold-tolerant, so it can handle being transplanted into cool soil. Just make sure seedlings are hardened off before transplanting. See our spring and fall planting dates for kohlrabi for your zip code or postal code. For a Spring Crop: Start seeds indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost Transplant seedlings (home-grown or nursery-grown) outdoors about 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost. We don’t recommend direct seeding kohlrabi for a spring crop. For a Fall Crop: For a fall crop of kohlrabi, timing is important since it needs to mature before the first fall frost/ Direct-seed in fall: 8 to 10 weeks before your average first fall frost date Or, set out fall transplants about 6 weeks before the first fall frost date. Kohlrabi typically takes about 50–60 days to mature, so this window gives it enough time to grow and bulb up before freezing temps set in. Cooler fall weather also improves flavor! In warmer regions such as the southern U.S., it may be grown as a winter crop, too. How to Plant Kohlrabi Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. If starting indoors, kohlrabi seeds don’t require a heating mat; they just need bright grow lights and cool room temperatures (60 to 70°F). Keep the soil moist, not too wet. After seedlings have germinated and are sporting new true leaves, fertilize with a half-strength starter solution once a week, then twice a week after two true leaves appear. Once the seedlings have 4 to 5 true leaves, transplant them into the soil at the same depth as the pot. Before transplanting young plants in the ground, harden off (bringing outdoors to a sheltered place for a couple of hours the first day and then for an extra hour or two each day for about a week). In rows, space kohlrabi seeds about 2 inches apart in rows 10 to 12 inches apart. If you plant outside, you’ll need to think. Once seedlings have emerged (4 to 7 days), thin them to every 5 to 8 inches. Stagger sowing every 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous summer. Watch a video on planting and growing kohlrabi:\n\n### When to Plant Kohlrabi\nKohlrabi is cold-tolerant, so it can handle being transplanted into cool soil.

The stem should be succulent, tender, and sweet at this size. If allowed to become too large, it can become tough and bitter. How to Store Kohlrabi Harvested stems can be stored with other root crops in a cool, humid place or in the refrigerator for up to 4 weeks.

With its <span class=\"caps\">UFO</span> shape and quirky charm, this cool-season crop may look alien, but it’s totally beginner-friendly. Kohlrabi grows fast (as little as 6 weeks!), tastes like a sweet, peppery cross between a turnip and an apple, and is packed with nutrients from root to leaf. Let’s get growing with&nbsp;kohlrabi!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Kohlrabi</h2><p>Kohlrabi can be grown as a spring or fall crop; hot summer temperatures will stress the plant and hamper the growth&nbsp;of its nutritious, bulb-shaped&nbsp;stem.</p><p>Kohlrabi, which can be either purple or green, is a member of the Brassica family (alongside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/broccoli\">broccoli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/cabbage\">cabbage</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/brussels-sprouts\">brussels sprouts</a>, and many others). It’s a&nbsp;biennial; in the first year, the bulb-shaped stem grows. In the second year, the plant will flower and produce&nbsp;seeds.&nbsp;</p><p>When eating, the outer tough layer needs to be removed with a vegetable peeler.&nbsp;The interior white flesh is sweet and tender with a crisp texture and peppery flavor.&nbsp;In terms of taste, think of kohlrabi&nbsp;as a milder <a href=\"https://almanac.com/plant/turnips\">turnip</a>. Some folks say it tastes somewhat of apple.&nbsp;It can be eaten raw, sprinkled with salt and lime or lemon juice. Or, slice thin and add to salads. You can cook kohlrabi, but only lightly, added last in a&nbsp;stir-fry.</p><p>Kohlrabi is not only enjoyed for its taste but its nutritional value. It offers vitamins C, A and K; minerals like calcium, potassium and iron; and phytochemicals that protect against certain cancers. Kohlrabi greens are also nutritious, containing carotenes, vitamins and minerals. Like other Brassicas, both the stem and greens are rich in dietary fiber that aids digestive&nbsp;health.</p><p>If given a chance, kohlrabi is simple to grow, fast to mature (in as little as 6 weeks), and is generally pest-free. Give it a&nbsp;try!</p><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"kohlrabi growing in a garden\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0553a98-e10b-4dee-ad2b-ebffa20a2b89\" height=\"1333\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/kohlrabi%20vaitekune%20GettyImages.jpg\" width=\"2000\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>Image credit: Vaitekune/GettyImages</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><br>&nbsp;</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-a2ccd9e7bc6a0d0c0f635908790b7d558dba5c3c87ab79f560e747324dfa2998\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/broccoli\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Broccoli: Planting, Growing &amp; Harvesting Tips</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/kale\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Kale: Planting, Care, and Harvest Tips for Healthy Greens</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/types-asian-greens-fast-growers-fall\" hreflang=\"und\">Growing Asian Greens: Bok Choy, Tatsoi, Mizuna, and More for Your Fall Garden</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n        <p>Plant in a location that receives ample sunlight (at least 6 hours, more is better) and has rich, slightly acidic, well-draining soil. While kohlrabi isn&#8217;t a heavy feeder, it is helped by having its soil dressed with 1 inch of compost before&nbsp;planting.</p><p>Avoid planting kohlrabi where other vegetables in the Brassica family have been grown in the previous 2 or 3 years. This helps to prevent the spread of disease and nutrient&nbsp;deficiencies.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Kohlrabi</h3><p>Kohlrabi is cold-tolerant, so it can handle being transplanted into cool soil. Just make sure seedlings are hardened off before transplanting. See our <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/planting-calendar\">spring and fall planting dates for kohlrabi</a> for your zip code or postal code.<br><br><u>For a Spring Crop:</u></p><ul><li>Start seeds indoors about 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring&nbsp;frost</li><li>Transplant seedlings (home-grown or nursery-grown) outdoors about 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring&nbsp;frost.</li><li>We don&#8217;t recommend direct seeding kohlrabi for a spring&nbsp;crop.</li></ul><p><u>For a Fall Crop</u>:</p><p>For a fall crop of kohlrabi, timing is important since it needs to mature before the first fall&nbsp;frost/</p><ul><li>Direct-seed in fall: 8 to 10 weeks before your average first fall frost&nbsp;date</li><li>Or, set out fall transplants about 6 weeks before the <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">first fall frost date</a>.</li></ul><p>Kohlrabi typically takes about 50–60 days to mature, so this window gives it enough time to grow and bulb up before freezing temps set in. Cooler fall weather also improves&nbsp;flavor!</p><p>In warmer regions such as the southern U.S., it may be grown as a winter crop,&nbsp;too.</p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Kohlrabi</h3><ul><li>Sow seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch&nbsp;deep.</li><li>If starting indoors, kohlrabi seeds don&#8217;t require a heating mat; they just need bright grow lights and cool room temperatures (60 to 70°F). Keep the soil moist, not too&nbsp;wet.</li><li>After seedlings have germinated and are sporting new true leaves, fertilize with a half-strength starter solution once a week, then twice a week after two true leaves&nbsp;appear.</li><li>Once the seedlings have 4 to 5 true leaves, transplant them into the soil at the same depth as the&nbsp;pot.</li><li>Before transplanting young plants in the ground, <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-harden-plants\">harden off</a> (bringing outdoors to a sheltered place for a couple of hours the first day and then for an extra hour or two each day for about a&nbsp;week).</li><li>In rows, space kohlrabi seeds about 2&nbsp;inches apart in rows 10 to 12 inches&nbsp;apart.</li><li>If you plant outside, you&#8217;ll need to think. Once seedlings have emerged (4 to 7 days), thin them to every 5 to 8&nbsp;inches.</li><li>Stagger sowing every 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Watch a video on planting and growing&nbsp;kohlrabi:&nbsp;</p><div class=\"youtube-container\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqtjsXtnALY\" width=\"720\"></iframe></div></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>If humidity is low, help to keep the soil moist by spreading a thin layer of straw or bark mulch around the base of the&nbsp;plant.</li><li>Water 1 inch per square foot per week, unless the soil seems to be drying out&nbsp;sooner.</li><li>Be diligent about weeding around kohlrabi, but be careful not to disturb its roots while the plant is still&nbsp;young.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/kohlrabi-purple_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"Purple kohlrabi\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li><strong>‘Early White Vienna&#8217;</strong>,<strong> ‘Early Purple Vienna&#8217;</strong>: 55-60 days to maturity; sweet and mild&nbsp;taste</li><li><strong>‘Gigante&#8217;</strong>: 130 days to maturity; grows up to 10 inches in diameter; stays crisp and&nbsp;sweet</li><li><strong>‘Grand Duke&#8217;</strong>: 50 days to maturity; can be left in garden without becoming&nbsp;tough</li><li><strong>‘Kolibri&#8217;</strong>: 45 days to maturity; soft, white flesh; purple-veined&nbsp;leaves</li><li><strong>‘Korridor&#8217;</strong>: 50 days to maturity; stores longer than most other&nbsp;varieties</li><li><strong>‘Kossak&#8217;</strong>: 80 days to maturity; grows up to 8 inches in diameter; stores&nbsp;well</li><li><strong>‘Superschmelz&#8217;</strong>: 60 days to maturity; grows deep roots to withstand drought; best grown in&nbsp;fall</li><li><strong>‘Winner&#8217;</strong>: 45-60 days to matuurity; fresh and fruity&nbsp;flavor</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest block--field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-harvest field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Harvesting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li>To harvest, cut the kohlrabi root off at ground level with a sharp knife when the bulbous stems are between 2 and 4 inches in&nbsp;diameter.</li><li>The stem should be succulent, tender, and sweet at this size.

When your plant flowers, it will produce seedpods. You should wait until the seedpods dry and become brown before harvesting. You will want to keep a close eye as they get close to maturity as the seedpods tend to shatter and it will lead to a feeding frenzy among the local birds.</p><p>You can harvest individual seedpods, or remove branches or the entire plant depending on its size. Once the seedpods are ready, rub them between your fingers to break open (if they did not open on their own).&nbsp;</p><p>Store collected seeds in a container in a cool, dry location and then plant the following spring or fall following the guidelines above.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-136177\" style=\"display:
