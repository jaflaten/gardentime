# Step 25 Implementation Progress - Canvas Drawing Tools

## ✅ Completed (Backend Infrastructure)

### 1. Database Layer
- ✅ Created `CanvasObject.kt` domain model with all required fields
- ✅ Created `CanvasObjectEntity` JPA entity
- ✅ Created `CanvasObjectType` enum (RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, LINE, ARROW, TEXT, FREEHAND)
- ✅ Added converter for enum persistence
- ✅ Created mapper functions (entity ↔ domain)
- ✅ Created Flyway migration `V5__create_canvas_object_table.sql`

### 2. Repository Layer
- ✅ Created `CanvasObjectRepository` with `findByGardenId()` method

### 3. Service Layer
- ✅ Created `CanvasObjectService` with full CRUD operations:
  - `createCanvasObject()` - Create single object
  - `getCanvasObjectsByGarden()` - Fetch all objects for a garden
  - `updateCanvasObject()` - Update existing object
  - `deleteCanvasObject()` - Delete object
  - `batchCreateCanvasObjects()` - Bulk create multiple objects
- ✅ Security checks ensure users can only access their own garden's objects

### 4. API Layer
- ✅ Created `CanvasObjectController` with REST endpoints:
  - `POST /api/canvas-objects` - Create object
  - `GET /api/canvas-objects/garden/{gardenId}` - Get all objects
  - `PUT /api/canvas-objects/{id}` - Update object
  - `DELETE /api/canvas-objects/{id}` - Delete object
  - `POST /api/canvas-objects/batch` - Batch create
- ✅ Request/Response DTOs created

### 5. Frontend API Integration (Next.js BFF)
- ✅ Added TypeScript types to `lib/api.ts`:
  - `CanvasObjectType` type
  - `CanvasObject` interface
  - `CreateCanvasObjectRequest` interface
  - `UpdateCanvasObjectRequest` interface
- ✅ Created `canvasObjectService` with methods matching backend
- ✅ Created Next.js API routes:
  - `/api/canvas-objects/route.ts` - POST
  - `/api/canvas-objects/[id]/route.ts` - PUT, DELETE
  - `/api/canvas-objects/garden/[gardenId]/route.ts` - GET
  - `/api/canvas-objects/batch/route.ts` - Batch POST

## ✅ Completed (Frontend Components)

### 1. Drawing Toolbar Component
- ✅ Created `DrawingToolbar.tsx` with all tool buttons:
  - SELECT (🖱️) - Select and move objects
  - PAN (✋) - Pan the canvas
  - RECTANGLE (▭) - Draw rectangles
  - CIRCLE (○) - Draw circles
  - LINE (─) - Draw lines
  - ARROW (→) - Draw arrows
  - TEXT (T) - Add text
  - FREEHAND (✏️) - Freehand drawing
- ✅ Active tool indicator with green highlight
- ✅ Tool help text that changes based on selected tool
- ✅ "Add Grow Area" button integration

### 2. Canvas Shape Component
- ✅ Created `CanvasShape.tsx` to render all canvas object types:
  - Rectangle rendering with fill and stroke
  - Circle rendering with proper radius calculation
  - Line rendering from points array
  - Arrow rendering with arrowheads
  - Text rendering with optional background
  - Freehand path rendering with smooth curves
- ✅ Selection highlighting (green shadow when selected)
- ✅ Lock/unlock support (locked shapes can't be dragged)
- ✅ Drag support for all shape types
- ✅ Opacity and rotation support

### 3. GardenBoardView Integration
- ✅ Added drawing tool state management
- ✅ Added canvas objects state
- ✅ Integrated `DrawingToolbar` component
- ✅ Integrated `CanvasShape` rendering in Layer
- ✅ Load canvas objects from backend on mount

## 🚧 In Progress

### Next Steps to Complete Step 25:

#### A. Drawing Interaction Logic (25.10)
- [ ] Implement mouse event handlers for drawing:
  - `onMouseDown` - Start drawing
  - `onMouseMove` - Update preview while drawing
  - `onMouseUp` - Finalize and save shape
- [ ] Add preview rendering while drawing
- [ ] Save completed shapes to backend
- [ ] Handle different drawing modes per tool type

#### B. Shape Properties Panel (25.6)
- [ ] Create properties panel component
- [ ] Color picker for fill and stroke
- [ ] Opacity slider
- [ ] Border width slider
- [ ] Line style selector
- [ ] Z-index controls
- [ ] Delete and duplicate buttons

#### C. Keyboard Shortcuts (25.1.4)
- [ ] V - Select tool
- [ ] Space - Pan tool
- [ ] R - Rectangle
- [ ] C - Circle
- [ ] L - Line
- [ ] A - Arrow
- [ ] T - Text
- [ ] P - Freehand
- [ ] Esc - Cancel drawing

#### D. Advanced Features (25.11)
- [ ] Hold Shift for perfect squares/circles
- [ ] Hold Shift for straight lines (horizontal/vertical/45°)
- [ ] Smart alignment guides
- [ ] Snap to grid option
- [ ] Alt+Drag to duplicate

#### E. Text Editing (25.3)
- [ ] Click to place text box
- [ ] Inline text editing on double-click
- [ ] Font size/style options
- [ ] Text background option

#### F. Layers Support (25.7)
- [ ] Multiple layer management
- [ ] Background layer for shapes
- [ ] Grow areas always on top
- [ ] Lock/unlock layers
- [ ] Show/hide layers

## 📊 Progress Summary

**Completed:** ~60% (Backend infrastructure, basic components)
**Remaining:** ~40% (Drawing interactions, properties panel, advanced features)

## 🔄 Next Immediate Actions

1. Test backend by running Spring Boot application
2. Run database migration to create canvas_object table
3. Implement mouse event handlers for drawing
4. Create shape properties panel
5. Add keyboard shortcuts
6. Test end-to-end flow (draw → save → reload)
