**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

## What Was Built

Comprehensive undo/redo system for the garden canvas with full keyboard shortcut support.

### Key Features

✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` - Undo last action
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Y` - Redo

✅ **Toolbar Buttons**
- Undo button (↶) with disabled state
- Redo button (↷) with disabled state
- Tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts

✅ **Action Tracking**
- Canvas object creation (all shape types)
- Canvas object updates (move, resize, property changes)
- Canvas object deletion and duplication
- Grow area movement (single and batch)
- Grow area resizing

✅ **Smart Management**
- Maximum 50 undo steps (configurable)
- Automatic cleanup of old actions
- Redo stack clears on new actions
- Before/after state tracking for reliable undo/redo

## How It Works

```
User Action → recordAction() → Undo Stack
                                    ↓
                            [Create, Move, Resize]
                                    ↓
                              Cmd+Z pressed
                                    ↓
                         Execute reverse action
                                    ↓
                          Move to Redo Stack
```

### Supported Actions

- **CREATE_OBJECT** - Creating shapes (undo = delete)
- **UPDATE_OBJECT** - Changing properties (undo = restore before state)
- **DELETE_OBJECT** - Deleting shapes (undo = recreate)
- **MOVE_GROW_AREA** - Moving grow areas (undo = restore position)
- **RESIZE_GROW_AREA** - Resizing grow areas (undo = restore size)
- **BATCH_MOVE** - Multi-select moves (undo = restore all positions)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Draw a shape, press Cmd+Z → shape disappears
- [ ] Press Cmd+Shift+Z → shape reappears
- [ ] Move a shape, undo → returns to original position
- [ ] Delete a shape, undo → shape is restored
- [ ] Change shape color, undo → color reverts
- [ ] Move grow area, undo → position reverts
- [ ] Multi-select and move, undo → all items revert
- [ ] Perform 50+ actions → old ones are removed
- [ ] Undo then make new change → redo button disables
- [ ] Buttons enable/disable correctly based on stack state
- [ ] Tooltips show correct keyboard shortcuts
