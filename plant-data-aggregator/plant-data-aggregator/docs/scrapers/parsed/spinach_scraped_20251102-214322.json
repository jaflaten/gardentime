  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Spinach\n\n\n### Planting\nSpinach tolerates full sun to light shade; prepare soil about a week before planting by mixing in compost. Alternatively, prepare the soil in late summer or early fall, when spinach can also be sown where winters are mild. When to Plant Spinach Spinach requires 6 weeks of cool weather from seeding to harvest; this is generally spring or fall, though many gardeners have better luck in the fall. Although seeds can be started indoors, it is not recommended, as seedlings are difficult to transplant. In the fall, sow seeds when the soil is 70°F or cooler. See our fall planting calendar. Many gardeners can grow spinach throughout the winter if they protect the young plants with a cold frame or thick mulch, then remove the protection when the soil temperature in your area reaches 40ºF in spring. Remove the mulch to harvest some spinach, then replace the mulch. If planting in the early spring, sow seeds as soon as the ground warms to 40°F. (Cover the soil with black plastic to speed its warming.) To distract leaf miners, sow spinach seeds and radish seeds in alternate rows. Leaf miner damage to radish tops does not affect their root growth. Common spinach cannot grow in midsummer as it’s not cool enough. (For a summer harvest, try New Zealand Spinach or Malabar Spinach, two similar leafy greens that are more heat-tolerant.) How to Plant Spinach Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep every 2 inches and cover with 1/2 inch of soil. Plant in rows 12 to 18 inches apart, or sprinkle over a wide row or bed. Sow every couple of weeks during early spring for a continuous harvest.\n\n### When to Plant Spinach\n- Spinach requires 6 weeks of cool weather from seeding to harvest; this is generally spring or fall, though many gardeners have better luck in the fall.\n- Although seeds can be started indoors, it is not recommended, as seedlings are difficult to transplant.\n- In the fall, sow seeds when the soil is 70°F or cooler.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Spinach\n\n\n### Growing\nWater spinach to keep soil constantly moist. Use row covers to maintain cool soil and deter pests. When seedlings sprout to about 2 inches, thin them to 3-4 inches apart. You can eat the thinnings. Beyond thinning, no cultivation is necessary. Roots are shallow and easily damaged. Water regularly and mulch to retain moisture. When plants reach one-third of their growth, side-dress with a high-nitrogen fertilizer as needed. Nutrient deficiencies may appear as yellow or pale leaves, stunted or distorted growth, a purpling or bronzing of leaves, leaves dropping early, or other symptoms. In early spring and late fall: Spinach can tolerate the cold; it can survive a frost and temps down to 15ºF (-9°C). (See local frost dates) Young spinach is more tender; cover if cold temps are in the forecast.\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Spinach\n\n\n### Harvesting\nHarvest a few outer leaves from each plant (so that inner leaves can develop) when leaves reach the desired size, or harvest the entire plant, cutting the stem at the base. Don’t wait too long to harvest or wait for larger leaves. Bitterness will set in quickly after maturity. Be aware of day length and heat: Increasing daylight (about 14 hours or longer) and warmer seasonal temperatures can cause spinach to bolt (develop a large stalk with narrower leaves and buds/flowers/seeds), which makes the leaf taste bitter. If spinach starts to bolt, pull the plant and use the leaves. Or try to slow the bolting: Pinch off the flower/seed heads, keep the soil moist, and provide shade. Harvesting spinach. Photo by Deyan Georgiev/Shutterstock. How to Store Spinach Fresh spinach leaves are good for up to a week. Too much moisture hastens their demise, so store fresh spinach unwashed and don’t wash until ready to use. Pat dry with a paper towel and put in a freezer bag with the towel to absorb moisture. Given its short shelf life, spinach is perfect for freezing. Wash, trim off ends and yellowing leaves, blanch, and pack into freezer bags. See how to freeze spinach.\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n",

greens? Spinach is one of the most rewarding cool-season crops you can grow—nutrient-packed, fast-growing, and surprisingly cold-hardy. In this complete guide, we’ll walk you through everything from planting to harvesting, plus share some tips to keep your leafy bounty coming all season long. Let’s get&nbsp;growing!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Spinach</h2><p>Spinach has similar cool-season growing conditions and requirements as <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/lettuce\">lettuce</a>, but it is more versatile in both its nutrition and its ability to be eaten raw or cooked. It is higher in iron, calcium, and vitamins than most cultivated greens and is one of the best sources of vitamins A, B, and&nbsp;C.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZl22VkcC_s?si=tcdg9ec1RQ57-c8C\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-994a617cb1948c8208a9a5b2b9b45df18979066669cf589a68303bf863a5e647\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/how-plant-fall-vegetable-garden\" hreflang=\"und\">What to Plant in a Fall Garden: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/edible-weeds-garden-eating-weeds\" hreflang=\"und\">20 Edible Weeds You Can Forage Right From Your Backyard</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/best-vegetables-cool-weather\" hreflang=\"und\">Early Spring Vegetables to Plant</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <p>Spinach tolerates full sun to light shade; prepare soil about a week before planting by mixing in compost. Alternatively, prepare the soil in late summer or early fall, when spinach can also be sown where winters are&nbsp;mild.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Spinach</h3><ul><li>Spinach requires 6 weeks of cool weather from seeding to harvest; this is generally spring or fall, though many gardeners have better luck in the&nbsp;fall.</li><li>Although seeds can be started indoors, it is not recommended, as seedlings are difficult to&nbsp;transplant.</li><li>In the fall, sow seeds when the soil is 70°F or cooler. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/planting-calendar\">See our fall planting calendar</a>.</li><li>Many gardeners can grow spinach throughout the winter if they protect the young plants with a <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-make-cold-frame-step-step\">cold frame</a> or thick mulch, then remove the protection when the soil temperature in your area reaches 40ºF in spring. Remove the mulch to harvest some spinach, then replace the&nbsp;mulch.</li><li>If planting in the early spring, sow seeds as soon as the ground warms to 40°F. (Cover the soil with black plastic to speed its&nbsp;warming.)</li><li>To distract leaf miners, sow spinach seeds and radish seeds in alternate rows. Leaf miner damage to radish tops does not affect their root&nbsp;growth.</li><li>Common spinach cannot grow in midsummer as it&#8217;s not cool enough. (For a summer harvest, try New Zealand Spinach or&nbsp;Malabar Spinach, two similar leafy greens that are more&nbsp;heat-tolerant.)</li></ul><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Spinach</h3><ul><li>Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep every 2 inches and cover with 1/2 inch of&nbsp;soil.</li><li>Plant in rows 12 to 18 inches apart, or sprinkle over a wide row or&nbsp;bed.</li><li>Sow every couple of weeks during early spring for a continuous&nbsp;harvest.</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li>Water spinach to keep soil constantly&nbsp;moist.</li><li>Use row covers to maintain cool soil and deter&nbsp;pests.</li><li>When seedlings sprout to about 2 inches, thin them to 3-4 inches apart.

Nutrient deficiencies may appear as yellow or pale leaves, stunted or distorted growth, a purpling or bronzing of leaves, leaves dropping early, or other&nbsp;symptoms.</li><li>In early spring and late fall: Spinach can tolerate the cold; it can survive a frost and temps down to 15ºF (-9°C).

Be aware of day length and heat: Increasing daylight (about 14 hours or longer) and warmer seasonal temperatures can cause spinach to bolt (develop a large stalk with narrower leaves and buds/flowers/seeds), which makes the leaf taste&nbsp;bitter.</li><li>If spinach starts to bolt, pull the plant and use the leaves.
