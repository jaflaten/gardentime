Plan to transplant seedlings into the garden about 2 weeks after that date or when the soil has warmed to at least 65°F (18°C). In warmer climates with long growing seasons, sow seeds directly outdoors 1 to 2 weeks after your last frost date, as long as the soil temperature has warmed to at least 65°F (18°C). Young watermelon plants can also be bought from nurseries. Plant these after there is no longer a chance of frost; they are very tender. Watch the local forecast and err on the side of caution! Consider laying black plastic over your planting area to warm the soil even more. Tip: Starting with young plants can result in an earlier harvest (usually up to 2 weeks earlier), so consider buying young plants, particularly if you live in a cooler climate. Choosing and Preparing a Planting Site Amend soil with aged manure, seaweed, and/or compost before planting. Watermelons are heavy feeders, meaning they need soil that is fertile and has a high nutrient level. Learn more about soil amendments and preparing soil for planting. Watermelons do best in loamy, somewhat sandy, well-drained soil. They can struggle in soil that contains too much clay and doesn’t drain well. Watermelons prefer a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.5 (“slightly acidic to neutral”). Watermelons need A LOT of space—up to 20 square feet per plant. Their vines need room to sprawl, so plant them in a place where they won’t crowd out other crops. Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the sun’s heat longer. Plan to space the plants 2-3 feet apart in a 5-foot-wide hill. If you’re growing in traditional rows, space them at least 6 feet apart. How to Plant Watermelons Sow seeds 1/2 to 1 inch deep outdoors or 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in seed-starting pots indoors. Tip: To allow for more root growth, use larger starting pots than you would for most seeds. Also, consider using compostable pots that can be cut away or planted directly in the garden, as this will minimize the risk of damaging seedlings’ tender roots during transplanting. If direct seeding outdoors, sow 4 to 6 seeds per hill, eventually thinning to 2 to 3 seedlings. Transplanting Seedlings Handle watermelon seedlings with extreme care when you transplant. Their roots are very fragile, so try not to disturb the soil when removing them from pots. After transplanting, cover the plants with row covers to keep pests at bay. Remember to remove the row covers when you see both male and female flowers on the vine, as pollinators will need to access the flowers.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Watermelons\n\n\n### Growing\nWatering Watermelons Watering is very important—from planting until fruit begins to form. While melon plants are growing, blooming, and setting fruit, they need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Keep soil moist but not waterlogged. Water at the vine’s base in the morning, and try to avoid wetting the leaves and avoid overhead watering. Reduce watering once fruit is growing. Dry weather produces the sweetest melon. Fertilizing If you choose to fertilize (and many do), make sure it delivers more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium, as this will encourage leaf and vine growth. However, after flowering begins, use a fertilizer with less nitrogen to instead encourage flowers and fruit. We like to use a seaweed-based fertilizer. Flowering and Fruiting Vines produce male and female flowers separately on the same plant. They often begin producing male flowers several weeks before the females appear. Do not be concerned if the male flowers fall off. The female flowers (which have a swollen bulb at the base) will stay on the vine and bear fruit. Blossoms require pollination to set fruit, so be kind to the bees! Learn how to support pollinators in your garden. As the fruit is ripening, prevent rotting by gently lifting it and putting cardboard or straw between the fruit and the soil. General Watermelon Care Tips Mulching with black plastic or straw around the plants will serve multiple purposes: it will warm the soil, hinder weed growth, and keep developing fruits off the soil. Pruning generally isn’t necessary for watermelon plants, but vine productivity may be improved if you do not allow lateral (side) vines to grow and stick to the main vine. When the plant is young, just cut off the end buds as they form (before the side shoots become vines). You can also pinch off some blossoms to focus the energy on fewer melons (though it’s challenging to kill off a potential fruit).\n\n### Watering Watermelons\n- Watering is very important—from planting until fruit begins to form.

  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Watermelons\n\n\n### Harvesting\nWatermelons don’t continue ripening after they are picked, so harvest time is important. They generally ripen over a two-week period, so keep your eye on them. How to Tell If a Watermelon Is Ripe Dr. Bill Rhodes, professor of horticulture at Clemson University, offers the following advice on how to tell when watermelons are ripe: Thump it. If the watermelon sounds hollow, it’s ripe. Look at the color on the top. The watermelon is ripe when there is little contrast between the stripes. Look at the color on the bottom. An immature watermelon will have a white bottom; a ripe melon will have a cream- or yellow-colored bottom. Press on it. If the watermelon sounds like it gives a little, it’s ripe. (Note: Rhodes doesn’t like this method because it can ruin the quality of the fruit.) Check the tendril. If it’s green, wait. If it’s half-dead, the watermelon is nearly ripe or ripe. If the tendril is fully dead, it’s ripe or overripe; it’s not going to get any riper, so you might as well pick! Stems should be cut with a sharp knife close to the fruit. Check out these tips for more ways to tell if a watermelon is ripe. How to Store Watermelons Watermelons can be stored uncut for about 10 days. If cut, they can last in the refrigerator for about 4 days. Wrap tightly in plastic.\n\n### How to Grow Tomatoes: Complete Guide to Planting & Harvesting\n",

Whether you&#8217;re in a warm climate or working with a short season, this guide covers everything from planting to picking the perfect melon. Let’s get&nbsp;growing!</p><h2>All About&nbsp;Watermelons</h2><p>Because watermelons need a long period of warm weather to grow well, they tend to be more popular in warmer climates with long growing seasons. However, gardeners in colder climates can still successfully grow watermelons by <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/starting-seeds-indoors\">starting seeds indoors</a>&nbsp;or purchasing young plants from a nursery and growing shorter-season varieties. Depending on the variety of watermelon, it can take between 70 and 100 days to go from planting to&nbsp;harvest.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-8db3185da3ac7b5485855b125ccd43d352b45158fd7a32955c1177c6c959d3b3\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/content/starting-seeds-indoors\" hreflang=\"und\">Starting Seeds Indoors: How and When to Start Seeds </a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/tomatoes\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Tomatoes: Complete Guide to Planting &amp; Harvesting</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/how-plant-fall-vegetable-garden\" hreflang=\"und\">What to Plant in a Fall Garden: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Watermelons</h3><ul><li>In cool climates with short growing seasons, start seeds indoors 2 to 3 weeks before your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">last frost date</a>. Plan to transplant seedlings into the garden about 2 weeks after that date or when the soil&nbsp;has warmed to at least 65°F&nbsp;(18°C).</li><li>In warmer climates with long growing seasons, sow seeds directly outdoors 1 to 2 weeks after your last frost date, as long as the soil temperature has warmed to at least 65°F&nbsp;(18°C).</li><li>Young watermelon plants can also be bought from nurseries. Plant these after there is no longer a chance of frost; they are very tender. Watch the local forecast and err on the side of caution! Consider laying black plastic over your planting area to warm the soil even more.<ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong> Starting with young plants can result in an earlier harvest (usually up to 2 weeks earlier), so consider buying young plants, particularly if you live in a cooler&nbsp;climate.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Choosing and Preparing a Planting&nbsp;Site</h3><ul><li>Amend soil with aged manure, seaweed,&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;compost before planting. Watermelons are heavy feeders, meaning they need soil that is fertile and has a high nutrient level.

They can struggle in soil that contains too much clay and doesn’t drain&nbsp;well.</li><li>Watermelons prefer a <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/ph-preferences\">soil pH</a> between 6.0 and 7.5&nbsp;(“slightly acidic to&nbsp;neutral”).</li><li>Watermelons need A <span class=\"caps\">LOT</span> of space—up to&nbsp;20&nbsp;square feet per plant. Their vines need room to sprawl, so plant them in a place where they won’t crowd out other&nbsp;crops.</li><li>Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the sun’s heat longer.<ul><li>Plan to space the plants 2-3 feet apart in a 5-foot-wide&nbsp;hill.</li><li>If you’re growing in traditional rows, space them at least 6&nbsp;feet&nbsp;apart.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/watermelon-vine_full_width.jpg\" alt=\"watermelon growing in a garden\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\"></p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Watermelons</h3><ul><li>Sow seeds 1/2 to 1 inch deep outdoors or 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in seed-starting pots indoors.<ul><li><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;To allow for more root growth, use larger starting pots than you would for most seeds.

They often begin producing male flowers several weeks before the females appear. Do not be concerned if the male flowers fall off.

When the plant is young, just cut off the end buds as they form (before the side shoots become vines). You can also pinch off some blossoms to focus the energy on fewer melons (though it’s challenging to kill off a potential&nbsp;fruit).</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li><strong>‘Sugar Baby’</strong>: 80 days to maturity.

They generally ripen over a two-week period,&nbsp;so keep your eye on&nbsp;them.</p><h3>How to Tell If&nbsp;a&nbsp;Watermelon&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Ripe</h3><p>Dr. Bill Rhodes, professor of horticulture at Clemson University, offers the following advice on how to tell when&nbsp;watermelons are&nbsp;ripe:</p><ul><li>Thump it. If the watermelon sounds hollow, it&#8217;s&nbsp;ripe.</li><li>Look at the color on the top. The watermelon is ripe when there is little contrast between the&nbsp;stripes.</li><li>Look at the color on the bottom. An immature watermelon will have a white bottom; a ripe melon will have a cream- or yellow-colored&nbsp;bottom.</li><li>Press on it. If the watermelon sounds like it gives a little, it&#8217;s ripe. (Note: Rhodes doesn&#8217;t like this method because it can ruin the quality of the&nbsp;fruit.)</li><li>Check the tendril. If it&#8217;s green, wait. If it’s half-dead, the watermelon is nearly ripe or ripe.

Watermelons do not like to be messed with once they start growing and very rarely get all the water they need causing stress from the beginning.  Don't bother with seed starting. See above and also they tend to develop root rot easily.  Dig a shovel deep hole. put in good compost or aged manure, cover with good dirt, make a mound, drop in 5 seeds, cover with more dirt, pat down and water gently but thoroughly. Don't let the mound dry out, don't move the long vines. You can move the new ones out of your way. Don't worry about weeds or grass, none of that will bother the melons and the more cover they have the more likely they will grow.  Know your zone.  My zone is 7b. It makes a big difference. Know your area. A small part seems to be in a dip and will have problems with light freezes.  I found this works with all melons. Plant well , water a lot and leave the heck alone.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-123645\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"119463\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Lee Speelmon&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 08/14/2021 - 16:28</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"119463\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90295\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      Each summer I take a STRAIGHT straw from a straw broom about 4 to 5 inches long and carry it in my pocket notebook which I use to check ripeness.
