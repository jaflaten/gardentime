  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting\nFlorence fennel likes full sun and fertile, well-drained soil. Work some organic matter in, but don’t overdo it. Soil that is too rich will result in bland, flavorless bulbs and foliage. A neutral pH of 6.5-7.5 is ideal for these heavy feeders. Common fennel can grow as high as six feet tall. If growing as an ornamental, place it in the back of a bed where its delicate foliage can be seen but won’t block the view of other, shorter plants. When To Plant Fennel Fennel can be planted in spring, as soon as the frost danger has passed, but is better grown as a fall crop. It is prone to bolting if it matures during hot weather and long days. Instead, plant fennel in midsummer for a fall crop. Since fennel does best as a cool-weather crop, it’s perfect to plant in your garden when earlier maturing crops are finished. Time it to be ready just before your first frost, as the foliage and bulb are only lightly frost tolerant. Direct seed about 80 days before your first frost date, depending on the variety. How To Plant Fennel Fennel can be directly seeded or transplanted, although transplanting can be tricky due to the tap root. Soaking fennel seeds for 24 hours can aid in germination. To start fennel indoors: About 4-6 weeks before your last frost, sow 2-3 seeds per cell in standard trays or soil blocks. Sow seeds ¼ inch deep. After germination, thin to one seedling per cell by snipping, not pulling. Harden off seedlings before transplanting into the garden. Fennel can be transplanted outdoors as soon as frost danger has passed. Don’t start them too early–fennel forms a taproot and can suffer extreme transplant shock if the taproot is injured. Direct seeding after the last frost in spring or in midsummer: Prepare the bed with compost, working it into the soil. Sow seeds ¼ inch deep, about one inch apart, in rows 18 inches apart. Gently water the seeded area. Once plants have a set of true leaves, thin to a spacing of 6-9 inches apart.\n\n### When To Plant Fennel\nFennel can be planted in spring, as soon as the frost danger has passed, but is better grown as a fall crop.

  "careInstructions" : "### Growing\nFennel likes fertile soil that is high in organic matter. Mulch to keep soil moisture even and slightly moist. Fennel typically blooms in the second year but can bolt in the first year (ruining the crop) if exposed to high heat and long days. If your transition from spring to summer is early and rapid, consider a late summer into fall crop for better success. Watering Fennel Fennel likes an inch of water per week or more but is drought tolerant once established (thanks to that taproot). Tip: Water in the morning. The plants will have water available during the heat of the day when needed most, and foliage will have a chance to dry before nightfall. Constantly damp vegetation can cause fungal issues. If your mornings are busy, consider a timer to turn your irrigation on and off.\n\n### Watering Fennel\nFennel likes an inch of water per week or more but is drought tolerant once established (thanks to that taproot).\nTip: Water in the morning.

  "harvestInfo" : "### Harvesting\nFennel is grown as an annual for foliage and as a vegetable. You can clip the fronds to use once the plant is established; they make a tasty addition to salads, teas, and more. Its tasty bulb can be harvested early as “baby” fennel, at about 3 inches in diameter, or allowed to mature to a 4-5 inch size fully. Many people prefer to harvest their fennel when the bulb is the size of a tennis ball for the best flavor and texture. Mature fennel bulbs are delicious on the grill! How to Pick Fennel Harvest using a garden knife or pruning shears, cutting at the base of the plant above the tap root. Store fennel in a cold environment with high humidity. If storing, cut the stalks and vegetation off about an inch above the bulb. Fennel seeds from second-year plants can be harvested when the flower head has turned brown. Snip off the heads and lay them on a screen or tray to dry. The heads will shatter, releasing the seeds.\n\n### How to Grow Turmeric Root—Planting to Harvest\n",

This easy-to-love herb is a win-win for your kitchen and your garden’s buzzing visitors. Ready to plant some fennel&nbsp;magic?</p><h2>About&nbsp;Fennel</h2><p>Fennel is grown as a tasty vegetable, as an ornamental for its beautiful and delicate foliage, as a pollinator attractor, and for its pungent and flavorful seeds. It’s one of our <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/growing-edible-flowers-your-garden\">favorite edible flowers to grow</a>! Easy to grow by direct seeding in midsummer, fennel deserves a spot in your herb garden or flower&nbsp;bed.</p><p>Florence fennel is the common name for <em>Foeniculum vulgare </em>var. <em>azoricum</em>, the biennial bulbing fennel grown as an annual for eating. While it can grow quite tall, shorter varieties are available, perfect for smaller&nbsp;spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Also called finocchio, this tasty vegetable is used for eating fresh, baked, and roasted, as an ingredient in soups, and its fresh leaves are used to flavor teas. The seeds are likely familiar to you as an essential flavoring in Italian sausage, as well as pastries and candies. It’s also one of the ingredients in the famous Chinese five-spice&nbsp;powder.</p><p>While not a native, fennel is a lovely and functional plant for pollinators, and the plant is a host for anise swallowtail and black swallowtail caterpillars! It can spread in warmer climates but rarely does so in cold&nbsp;areas.</p><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"fennel flower\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cdb632c3-4e3f-4a8b-8ce9-cd37090c4ead\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-13%20at%203.00.11%20PM.png\" width=\"1460\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Many pollinators love the beautiful fennel flowers!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-841b9933c28493e036f660c3395687458881d98db0d0e781bb49a7a447bb83ee\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/anise-hyssop-how-grow-and-care-fragrant-herb\" hreflang=\"en\">Anise Hyssop: How to Grow and Care for This Fragrant Herb</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/how-grow-chervil-delicate-licorice-loved-herb-your-garden\" hreflang=\"en\">How to Grow Chervil: A Delicate, Licorice-Loved Herb for Your Garden</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/how-grow-turmeric-root-planting-harvest\" hreflang=\"en\">How to Grow Turmeric Root—Planting to Harvest</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n        <p>Florence fennel likes full sun and fertile, well-drained soil. Work some organic matter in, but don’t overdo it. Soil that is too rich will result in bland, flavorless bulbs and foliage.&nbsp;A neutral pH of 6.5-7.5 is ideal for these heavy&nbsp;feeders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Common fennel can grow as high as six feet tall. If growing as an ornamental, place it in the back of a bed where its delicate foliage can be seen but won’t block the view of other, shorter&nbsp;plants.</p><h3>When To Plant&nbsp;Fennel</h3><p>Fennel can be planted in spring, as soon as the frost danger has passed, but is better grown as a fall crop. It is prone to bolting if it matures during hot weather and long days. Instead, plant fennel in midsummer for a fall&nbsp;crop.&nbsp;</p><p>Since fennel does best as a cool-weather crop, it’s perfect to plant in your garden when earlier maturing crops are finished. Time it to be ready just before your first frost, as the foliage and bulb are only lightly frost tolerant. Direct seed about 80 days before your first frost date, depending on the&nbsp;variety.</p><h3>How To Plant&nbsp;Fennel</h3><p>Fennel can be directly seeded or transplanted, although transplanting can be tricky due to the tap root. Soaking fennel seeds for 24 hours can aid in&nbsp;germination.</p><p><u>To start fennel indoors:</u></p><ul><li>About 4-6 weeks before your last frost, sow 2-3 seeds per cell in standard trays or soil blocks.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Sow seeds ¼ inch deep.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>After germination, thin to one seedling per cell by snipping, not pulling.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Harden off seedlings before transplanting into the garden.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Fennel can be transplanted outdoors as soon as frost danger has passed. Don’t start them too early–fennel forms a taproot and can suffer extreme transplant shock if the taproot is&nbsp;injured.</li></ul><p><u>Direct seeding after the last frost in spring or in midsummer</u>:</p><ul><li>Prepare the bed with compost, working it into the soil.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Sow seeds ¼ inch deep, about one inch apart, in rows 18 inches apart.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Gently water the seeded area.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Once plants have a set of true leaves, thin to a spacing of 6-9 inches&nbsp;apart.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n        <ul><li>Fennel likes fertile soil that is high in organic matter.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Mulch to keep soil moisture even and slightly moist.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Fennel typically blooms in the second year but can bolt in the first year (ruining the crop) if exposed to high heat and long days.

The plants will have water available during the heat of the day when needed most, and foliage will have a chance to dry before nightfall. Constantly damp vegetation can cause fungal issues. If your mornings are busy, consider a timer to turn your irrigation on and off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li>‘<strong>Orazio</strong>’ is a hybrid with heavy, round, white bulbs and a crisp, anise flavor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>‘<strong>Fino</strong>’ is an open-pollinated variety with a good bulb and is bolt-resistant.

You can clip the fronds to use once the plant is established; they make a tasty addition to salads, teas, and more. Its tasty bulb can be harvested early as “baby” fennel, at about 3 inches in diameter, or allowed to mature to a 4-5 inch size fully. Many people prefer to harvest their fennel when the bulb is the size of a tennis ball for the best flavor and&nbsp;texture.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/how-grill-vegetables\">Mature fennel bulbs are delicious on the&nbsp;grill!</a></p><h3>How to Pick&nbsp;Fennel</h3><ul><li>Harvest using a garden knife or pruning shears, cutting at the base of the plant above the tap root.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Store fennel in a cold environment with high humidity.

Probably something for people to know. I was going to just toss the seeds before I learned of its invasiveness. Another historical tidbit I just learned from a book, Perilous Journey by C.M. Sublette, is that Johnny Appleseed, aside from planting apple seeds where ever he went, also tossed fennel seeds and was responsible for them growing wildly across country wherever he had been. \n
