Sweet potatoes aren’t too picky, but they do prefer soil on the sandier side. They need plenty of air space for their roots to reach down. If your soil is clayey, rocky, or compacted, consider growing in raised beds. Add compost, perlite, and/or coconut coir to the growing area to build fertile, loamy soil down to 8 to 10 inches. Avoid adding animal manure, including pelleted chicken manure; it can result in spindly and/or stained roots. Also, avoid heavy nitrogen fertilizers, which produce lush leaf growth at the expense of the edible roots! If you ordered slips from a mail-order source, unpack them right away. Stick the roots in water for a day or so, and they’ll perk up. Plant them as soon as conditions are right. When to Plant Sweet Potatoes Transplant sweet potato slips outdoors, 3 to 4 weeks after your last spring frost or once the soil has warmed to at least 65°F (18°C). Nighttime temperatures should be at least 55°F (13°C). The trick is to plant them early enough to have time to mature fully, but not so early that they get killed by a late spring frost. Young sweet potatoes are very tender, so they must be protected from late frosts or cool nights (lower than 55°F/13°C). Cover them with plastic milk jugs or row covers, removing the covers during the day. Sweet potatoes are grown from slips—sprouts grown from existing potatoes! Credit: Lex20/Getty Images. How to Grow Your Own Sweet Potato Slips You can start your own slips instead of buying them, but it’s more work. Here’s how: About 8 weeks before your last spring frost date, look for unblemished, smooth, organic sweet potatoes at the store or farmers’ market. Be sure to ask about the variety and check that it’s one you want to grow. Place whole sweet potatoes in pots or bins that contain at least 3 inches of light, organic, well-draining soil. Leave an inch or two of space between each sweet potato. Lightly cover with a few inches of additional soil. Water now and as needed to keep soil damp but not soggy. Maintain the soil and the room at 75°F to 80°F in sunlight or under artificial lights. Use a heating mat if necessary; sweet potatoes respond well to warm temperatures. Soon, slips (shoots) will emerge from the soil. After about 6 to 8 weeks, the slips should be between 6 and 12 inches long, with a number of leaves and roots. Remove the slips from the sweet potatoes with roots attached. (If no roots have formed on the slip itself, remove the slip and place it in water; roots should appear in 1 to 2 weeks.) If it is still too soon to plant outdoors, stand the slips in potting mix or sand and keep them moist until the right planting time (3 to 4 weeks after the last frost). Harden off the slips (before planting outdoors) for 1 to 2 weeks by exposing them to filtered sunlight outdoors during the day. How to Plant Sweet Potatoes Create raised mounds 6 to 8 inches tall and about 12 inches wide. Plan 3 feet between mounds so there is enough space for vines to run. Plant the slips on a warm, overcast day when the soil temperature has reached 60°F (15°C). Break off the lower leaves, leaving only the top ones. Set the slips deep enough to cover the roots and the stem up to the leaves. Sweet potatoes will form on the nodes. Water with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer, then water generously for 7 to 10 days to make sure that the plants root well.\n\n### When to Plant Sweet Potatoes\n- Transplant sweet potato slips outdoors, 3 to 4 weeks after your last spring frost or once the soil has warmed to at least 65°F (18°C).

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Sweet Potatoes\n\n\n### Growing\nSide-dress the sweet potato plants 3 to 4 weeks after transplanting with 5-10-10 fertilizer. If you have sandy soil, use more. Weed the sweet potato beds regularly, starting 2 weeks after planting. Avoid deep digging with a hoe or other tool that disturbs the delicate feeder roots. Water regularly, especially during midsummer. Deep watering in hot, dry periods will help to increase yields. Do not prune sweet potato vines; they should be vigorous. Late in the season, reduce watering to avoid cracking of the sweet’s skin—a problem in storage. We think sweet potatoes make a nice ground cover, too! Credit: Getty Images. Growing Sweet Potatoes in Containers Bush-type sweet potato plants are ideal for container growers. The vines that they produce are short and compact, not sprawling like typical sweets—but the roots are full size, not miniatures. While slips mature, prepare a large container or tub. (A too-small container can result in small, curly sweets or fewer than hoped for.) A 10-gallon container can support two or three sweet potatoes; a 20-gallon, four to six. A half-barrel container (20 to 25 gallons) is ideal. Place the container where it will receive full sunlight every day. (It will be heavy to move once filled and planted.) Sweets like moist but not wet soil; the medium must be well-draining and rich; sweets are also heavy feeders. Provide potting mix amended with compost, sand, bonemeal (for potassium), and wood ash (for potash). Minimize nitrogen or risk producing heavily leafy tops and spindly roots. If you purchase a bush variety, soak the roots in water for a few hours before planting. Plant slips 3 to 4 weeks after the last spring frost, when the soil has warmed to 65°F and nighttime temperatures are at least 55°F. Mulch with black plastic before and during the season, if necessary, to capture or retain heat. Set slips 4 inches deep on a bed of compost, then cover up to their bottom leaves. Water with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer (5-10-10) for 7 to 10 days to ensure that the plants root well.\n\n### Growing Sweet Potatoes in Containers\nBush-type sweet potato plants are ideal for container growers.

  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Sweet Potatoes\n\n\n### Harvesting\nYou can start digging up the roots when they are big enough for a meal. Harvest when the leaves and ends of the vines have started turning yellow or about 100 days from planting. Loosen the soil around each plant (18 inches around, 4 to 6 inches deep) to avoid injuring the roots. Cut away some of the vines. Pull up the plant’s primary crown and dig the roots by hand. Handle the sweet potatoes carefully, as they bruise easily. Shake off any excess dirt; do not wash the roots. Complete harvesting by the first fall frost. How to Cure and Store Sweet Potatoes Curing sweet potatoes gives them a sweet taste and also allows a second skin to form over scratches and bruises. Handle sweet potatoes carefully; they bruise easily. To cure, store roots in a warm place (about 80°F) at high humidity (about 90%) for 10 to 14 days. A table outside in a shady spot works well. Arrange sweet potatoes so that they are not touching. After curing, discard bruised sweet potatoes, then wrap each one in newspaper. Carefully pack in a wooden box or basket. Store in a root cellar, basement, or the like with a high humidity at 55° to 60°F. The roots should last in storage for about 6 months.\n\n### How to Grow Eggplant (Aubergines): Planting, Growing & Harvesting Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Horseradish: Plant, Grow, and Harvest This Spicy Root\n",

Sweet potatoes aren’t just tasty and nutritious—they’re garden rock stars! With their tropical vibes, sprawling vines, and vibrant orange roots, these heat-loving plants thrive with minimal fuss. Whether you’re in the sunny South or giving them a go up North with raised beds and clever hacks, we’ll show you how to turn a humble root into a delicious&nbsp;harvest.</p><p>This nutritious, sweet-tasting root vegetable is heat-tolerant and pest-resistant. Here is everything you need to know about growing sweet&nbsp;potatoes.</p><p>Though commonly grown in the South because they require warm weather, sweet potatoes can be successfully grown in northern regions, too. See our advice on which varieties to choose&nbsp;below.</p><h2>About Sweet&nbsp;Potatoes</h2><p>The sweet potato is a tropical plant and is actually a member of the<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/morning-glories\"> Morning Glory family</a>. Compare a sweet potato vine’s foliage and flowers to those of morning glory, and you’ll see the family resemblance! Despite their name, they are not related to <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/potatoes\">potatoes</a>, which are in the nightshade family. Another difference between sweet potatoes and “standard” potatoes is that the edible portion of the sweet potato is a tuberous root, not a true tuber (which are technically modified plant&nbsp;stems).&nbsp;</p><p>This root vegetable has deep-orange flesh and a coppery skin jacket. Sweet potatoes are commonly served cooked in mashed form or roasted whole. They may also be used as<a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/recipe/sweet-potato-pie\"> pie&nbsp;filling.</a></p><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"Sweet potatoes cut open\" height=\"480\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/sweet-potatoes_brenthofacker-ss_full_width.jpg\" width=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>Photo Credit: Brent Hofacker/Shutterstock</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This tropical crop needs at least 4 months of warm weather and warm soil, but they are drought- and heat-tolerant and have few pests or diseases. Although traditionally a southern crop, many short-season sweet potato varieties exist today. They will grow in the North (even parts of Canada!) when grown in sandy soil or raised beds mulched with black plastic to keep the soil&nbsp;warm.</p><h3>Sweet Potato&nbsp;Slips</h3><p>Note that sweet potatoes are not grown from seed. Instead, they’re grown from slips, which are sprouts from existing sweet potatoes. Slips are often available at local garden centers and nurseries, from local farmers (such as farmers’ markets), or mail-order companies. Or you can start your own (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>Before you order slips, please make sure that you have a long enough growing season to grow sweet potatoes. Most varieties will take about 90 to 120 days to mature. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">See your frost dates and length of growing season</a>. Also, ensure you time your order with your planting dates in&nbsp;mind!</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-a423cf8569f66d8ae394ccb6faf0c504c194df7f1c49f0bb252ad41721cc35a3\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/growing-sweet-potatoes-northern-garden\" hreflang=\"und\">Growing Sweet Potatoes in a Northern Garden</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/how-are-yams-and-sweet-potatoes-different\" hreflang=\"und\">How Are Yams and Sweet Potatoes Different?</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/eggplants\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Eggplant (Aubergines): Planting, Growing &amp; Harvesting Tips</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n        <h3>Where to&nbsp;Plant</h3><p>Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil. Sweet potatoes aren’t too picky, but they do prefer soil on the sandier side. They need plenty of air space for their roots to reach down. If your soil is clayey, rocky, or compacted, consider growing in raised&nbsp;beds.</p><p>Add compost, perlite, and/or <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/what-is-coco-coir\">coconut coir</a> to the growing area to build fertile, loamy soil down to 8 to 10 inches. Avoid adding animal manure, including pelleted chicken manure; it can result in spindly and/or stained roots. Also, avoid heavy nitrogen fertilizers, which produce lush leaf growth at the expense of the edible&nbsp;roots!</p><p>If you ordered slips from a mail-order source, unpack them right away. Stick the roots in water for a day or so,&nbsp;and they’ll perk up.&nbsp;Plant them as soon as conditions are&nbsp;right.</p><h3>When to Plant Sweet&nbsp;Potatoes</h3><ul><li>Transplant sweet potato slips outdoors,&nbsp;<strong>3 to 4 weeks after your&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\"><strong>last spring frost</strong></a>&nbsp;or once the soil has warmed to at least 65°F (18°C). Nighttime temperatures should be&nbsp;at least 55°F (13°C). The trick is to plant them early enough to have time to mature fully, but not so early that they get killed by a late spring&nbsp;frost.</li><li>Young sweet potatoes are very tender, so they must be protected from late frosts or cool nights (lower than 55°F/13°C). Cover them with plastic milk jugs or row covers, removing the covers during the&nbsp;day.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"a sweet potato slip ready to be planted in the garden\" height=\"828\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/planting_sweet_potato_lex20_gettyimages_full_width.jpg\" width=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>Sweet potatoes are grown from slips—sprouts grown from existing potatoes!&nbsp;</em><br><em>Credit: Lex20/Getty Images.</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How to Grow Your Own Sweet Potato&nbsp;Slips</h3><p><span style=\"font-size:1.125rem;\">You can start your own slips instead of buying them, but it’s more work. Here’s&nbsp;how:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:1.125rem;\">About 8 weeks before your last spring frost date, look for unblemished, smooth, organic sweet potatoes at the store or farmers’ market. </span>Be sure to ask about the variety and check that it’s one you want to&nbsp;grow.</li><li>Place whole sweet potatoes in pots or bins that contain at least&nbsp;3 inches of light, organic, well-draining soil. Leave an inch or two of space between each sweet&nbsp;potato.</li><li>Lightly cover with a few inches of additional soil. Water now and as needed to keep soil damp&nbsp;but not&nbsp;soggy.</li><li>Maintain the soil and the room at 75°F to 80°F in sunlight or under artificial lights. Use a heating mat&nbsp;if necessary; sweet potatoes respond well to warm&nbsp;temperatures.</li><li>Soon, slips (shoots) will emerge from the&nbsp;soil.</li><li>After about 6 to 8&nbsp;weeks, the slips should be between 6 and&nbsp;12 inches long, with a number of leaves and&nbsp;roots.</li><li>Remove the slips from the sweet potatoes with roots attached. (If no roots have formed on the slip itself, remove the slip and place it in water; roots should appear in 1 to 2&nbsp;weeks.)</li><li>If it is still too soon to plant outdoors, stand the slips in potting mix or sand and keep them moist until the right planting time (3 to 4 weeks after the last&nbsp;frost).</li><li>Harden off the slips (before planting outdoors) for 1 to 2 weeks by exposing them to filtered sunlight outdoors during the&nbsp;day.</li></ul><h3>How to Plant Sweet&nbsp;Potatoes</h3><ul><li>Create raised mounds 6 to 8 inches tall and about 12 inches&nbsp;wide.</li><li>Plan 3 feet between mounds so there is enough space for vines to&nbsp;run.</li><li>Plant the slips on a warm, overcast day when the soil temperature has reached 60°F&nbsp;(15°C).</li><li>Break off the lower leaves, leaving only the top&nbsp;ones.</li><li>Set the slips deep enough to cover the roots and the stem up to the leaves. Sweet potatoes will form on the&nbsp;nodes.</li><li>Water with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer, then water generously for 7 to 10 days to make sure that the plants root&nbsp;well.</li></ul></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        <ul><li>Side-dress the sweet potato plants 3 to 4 weeks after transplanting with 5-10-10 fertilizer.

Deep watering in hot, dry periods will help to increase&nbsp;yields.</li><li>Do not prune sweet potato vines; they should be&nbsp;vigorous.</li><li>Late in the season, reduce watering to avoid cracking of the sweet’s skin—a problem in&nbsp;storage.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"sweet potatoes planted in the garden make a nice ground cover\" height=\"480\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/sweet_potato_gettyimages_full_width.jpg\" width=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>We think sweet potatoes make a nice ground cover, too!&nbsp;</em><br><em>Credit: Getty Images</em>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Growing Sweet Potatoes in&nbsp;Containers</h3><p>Bush-type sweet potato plants are ideal for container growers. The vines that they produce are short and compact, not sprawling like typical sweets—but the roots are full size, not&nbsp;miniatures.&nbsp;</p><p>While slips mature, prepare a large container or tub. (A too-small container can result in small, curly sweets or fewer than hoped for.) A 10-gallon container can support two or three sweet potatoes; a 20-gallon, four to six. A half-barrel container (20 to 25 gallons) is ideal. Place the container where it will receive full sunlight every day. (It will be heavy to move once filled and&nbsp;planted.)&nbsp;</p><p>Sweets like moist but not wet soil; the medium must be well-draining and rich; sweets are also heavy feeders. Provide potting mix amended with compost, sand, bonemeal (for potassium), and wood ash (for potash). Minimize nitrogen or risk producing heavily leafy tops and spindly roots. If you purchase a bush variety, soak the roots in water for a few hours before&nbsp;planting.</p><p>Plant slips 3 to 4 weeks after the last spring frost, when the soil has warmed to 65°F and nighttime temperatures are at least 55°F. Mulch with black plastic before and during the season, if necessary, to capture or retain heat. Set slips 4 inches deep on a bed of compost, then cover up to their bottom leaves. Water with a high-phosphorus liquid fertilizer (5-10-10) for 7 to 10 days to ensure that the plants root&nbsp;well.</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n        <p>The fastest-growing sweet potato varieties have orange flesh, but you might also consider varieties with white, yellow, or even purple flesh.

You want your slips to be about 6 to 12 inches tall when you begin the rooting process. If yours are much longer than that, you can certainly trim them back (do so below a node). But, if your slips are long enough, you can also divide them into multiple sections to root. If they are leggy and thin, it might be best to cut back to where the slips are thicker and more firm and just root those ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-133396\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"133098\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Del Bromm&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 02/17/2024 - 10:18</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"133098\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90291\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      We have what is called an 'Old Fashioned German WHITE Sweet Potato'.

We like these much better than the Orange/soft textured type. They also hold up much better being baked/roasted and are difficult to find.
