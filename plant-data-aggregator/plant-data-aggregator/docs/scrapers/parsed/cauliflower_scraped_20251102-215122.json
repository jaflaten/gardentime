Lack of sunlight may produce thin, leggy plants and subpar heads. In summer, shade plants from the hot sun, if necessary. Soil needs to be very rich in organic matter; mix aged manure and/or compost into the bed before planting. As an alternative, apply 5-10-10 fertilizer to the planting site. Fertile soil helps to prevent heads from buttoning. When to Plant Cauliflower Cauliflower grows best as a fall crop (cool weather is best for head formation), but can be grown in spring, too. We suggest buying cauliflower seedlings (aka “transplants”) versus starting them from seed, as cauliflower can be finicky. Spring Planting: If you start from seed, sow seeds indoors 4 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date. Plant seedlings outdoors 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring frost date. Fall Planting: Plant a fall crop 6 to 8 weeks before the first fall frost date, but after daytime temperatures are regularly below 75°F. How to Plant Cauliflower Sow seeds in rows 3 to 6 inches apart and up to ½ inch deep. Set plants 18 to 24 inches apart with 30 inches between rows. In early spring, be ready to protect plants from frost by covering them with old milk jugs, if necessary. Extreme cold can halt growth and/or form buttons. Water consistently during germination and growth. Add mulch to conserve moisture.\n\n### When to Plant Cauliflower\n- Cauliflower grows best as a fall crop (cool weather is best for head formation), but can be grown in spring, too.\n- We suggest buying cauliflower seedlings (aka “transplants”) versus starting them from seed, as cauliflower can be finicky.\n- Spring Planting: If you start from seed, sow seeds indoors 4 to 5 weeks before the last spring frost date.

  "careInstructions" : "### Master the cool-season secret to growing crisp, healthy cauliflower\n\n\n### Growing\nCauliflower dislikes any interruption to its growth. Change, in the form of temperature, moisture, soil nutrition, or insects, can cause the plants to develop a head prematurely or ruin an existing one. Water regularly with 2 inches of water per square foot each week; even with normal rainfall, cauliflower usually requires supplemental watering. For best growth, side-dress the plants with a high-nitrogen fertilizer 3 to 4 weeks after transplanting. Note that the cauliflower will start out as a loose head and that it takes time for the head to fully form. Many varieties take at least 75 to 85 days from transplant. Be patient! Brown heads indicate a boron deficiency in the soil. Drench with 1 tablespoon of borax in 1 gallon of water. (Avoid getting boron on other plants.) Or, provide liquid seaweed extract immediately; repeat every 2 weeks until symptoms disappear. In the future, add more compost to the soil. For white varieties, pink heads can indicate too much sun exposure or temperature fluctuations. Purple hues can be due to stress or low soil fertility. Blanching Cauliflower Heads When the curd (the white head) is 2 to 3 inches in diameter, blanch it: Tie the outer leaves together over the head and secure with a rubber band, tape, or twine to keep light out. (This is not necessary for self-blanching or colored varieties). The plants are usually ready for harvest 7 to 12 days after blanching.\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n\n\n### How to Grow Cabbage: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Kohlrabi: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Tips\n",
  "harvestInfo" : "### Harvesting\nPlants are usually ready to harvest in about 50 to 100 days, depending on variety, or 7 to 12 days after blanching. When the heads are compact, white, and firm, then it is time to harvest them. Ideally, the heads will grow to 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Cut the heads off the plant with a large knife. Be sure to leave some of the leaves around the head to keep it protected. If the heads are too small, but have already started to open up, they will not improve and should be harvested immediately. If the cauliflower has a coarse appearance, it is past maturity and should be tossed. How to Store Cauliflower Store heads in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. They should last for about a week. For long-term storage, you can also freeze or pickle the heads. To freeze, cut into 1-inch-bite pieces. Blanch for 3 minutes in lightly salted water. Cool in an ice bath for 3 minutes, drain, and package. Seal and freeze.\n\n### How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens\n\n\n### When to Harvest Vegetables and Fruit for Peak Flavor\n\n\n### How to Grow Cabbage: Planting, Care & Harvest Tips\n\n\n### How to Grow Kohlrabi: Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Tips\n",

Whether you’re after classic white or craving purple or orange flair, this cool-season crop is a garden standout. Just give it some sunshine, steady temps, and a little <span class=\"caps\">TLC</span>—and it’ll reward you with nutty, tender heads perfect for roasting, ricing, or sneaking into mac and cheese. Ready to grow your own superfood? Let’s get&nbsp;planting!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Cauliflower</h2><p>This vegetable&#8217;s name comes from the Latin words <em>caulis</em>, for cabbage, and <em>floris</em>, for flower. It&#8217;s a descendant of wild cabbage!&nbsp;Like its cousin <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/broccoli\">broccoli</a>, the tightly bunched florets of cauliflower are connected by a thick core, often with a few light leaves surrounding&nbsp;it.</p><p><a class=\"text-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/4cSZJJu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Seeds&nbsp;Now</a></p><p>Though usually white, cauliflower also comes in other colors, including purple, yellow, and orange. No matter the color, the taste is the same: mild, slightly sweet, and a little&nbsp;nutty.</p><p>Cauliflower can be a challenge for beginner gardeners because it requires consistently cool temperatures in the 60°Fs. Otherwise, it may prematurely “button”—form small, button-size heads—rather than forming a single, large&nbsp;head.</p>\n      </div>\n      \n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 block--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 flex flex-col\">\n  \n      <h3 class=\"block__title block-title block-title--views-blockmore-like-this-block-2 font-normal mt-0\">\n      Read Next\n    </h3>\n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        <div><div class=\"js-view-dom-id-5176134735feb89c2a62b125e4bdb8d0edb7f5d040de95cf81bffc03983f403d\">\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  <div class=\"item-list\">\n  \n  <ul>\n\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/swiss-chard\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Swiss Chard: Planting, Care &amp; Harvest Tips for Colorful Greens</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/when-harvest-vegetables-and-fruit-best-flavor\" hreflang=\"und\">When to Harvest Vegetables and Fruit for Peak Flavor</a></div></li>\n          <li><div class=\"views-field views-field-title\"><a href=\"/plant/cabbage\" hreflang=\"und\">How to Grow Cabbage: Planting, Care &amp; Harvest Tips</a></div></li>\n    \n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-planting block--field-blocknodeplantfield-planting flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-planting field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Planting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n        <p>Cauliflower should be grown in a spot that gets full sun (6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day). Lack of sunlight may produce thin, leggy plants and subpar heads. In summer, shade&nbsp;plants from the hot&nbsp;sun, if&nbsp;necessary.</p><p>Soil needs to be very rich in <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/blog/gardening/garden-journal/organic-soil-amendments-explained\">organic matter</a>; mix aged manure and/or&nbsp;compost into the bed before planting. As an alternative, apply 5-10-10 fertilizer to the planting site.&nbsp;Fertile soil helps to prevent heads from&nbsp;buttoning.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Cauliflower</h3><ul><li>Cauliflower grows best as a fall crop (cool weather is best for head formation), but can be grown in spring,&nbsp;too.</li><li>We suggest buying cauliflower seedlings (aka “transplants”) versus starting them from seed, as cauliflower can be&nbsp;finicky.</li><li><strong>Spring Planting:</strong><ul><li>If you start from seed, sow seeds indoors 4 to 5 weeks before the <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">last spring&nbsp;frost date</a>.</li><li>Plant seedlings outdoors 2 to 4 weeks before the last spring&nbsp;frost&nbsp;date.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fall Planting:</strong><ul><li>Plant a fall crop 6 to 8 weeks before the first fall frost date, but after daytime temperatures are regularly below&nbsp;75°F.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Cauliflower</h3><ul><li>Sow seeds in rows 3 to 6 inches apart and up to ½&nbsp;inch&nbsp;deep.</li><li>Set plants 18 to 24 inches apart with 30 inches between&nbsp;rows.</li><li>In early spring, be ready to protect plants from frost by covering them with old milk jugs, if necessary. Extreme cold can halt growth and/or form&nbsp;buttons.</li><li>Water consistently during germination and growth. Add <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/blog/gardening/garden-journal/mulching-guide-benefits-mulch\">mulch</a> to conserve&nbsp;moisture.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/cauliflower-plant.jpg\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d78955c-48ef-46e7-a1ec-71f259f00a67\" data-entity-type=\"file\" alt=\"cauliflower growing in the garden\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                              \n        <ul><li>Cauliflower dislikes any&nbsp;interruption to its&nbsp;growth.

Many varieties take at least 75 to 85 days from transplant. Be&nbsp;patient!</li><li>Brown heads indicate a boron deficiency in the soil. Drench with 1 tablespoon of borax in 1 gallon of water. (Avoid getting boron on other plants.) Or, provide liquid seaweed extract immediately; repeat every 2 weeks until symptoms disappear. In the future, add more compost to the&nbsp;soil.</li><li>For white varieties, pink heads can indicate too much sun exposure or temperature fluctuations. Purple hues can be due to stress or low soil&nbsp;fertility.</li></ul><h3>Blanching Cauliflower&nbsp;Heads</h3><p>When the curd (the white head) is 2 to 3 inches in diameter, blanch it: Tie the outer leaves together over the head and secure with a rubber band, tape, or twine to keep&nbsp;light out. (This is not necessary for self-blanching or colored varieties). The plants are usually ready for harvest 7 to 12 days after&nbsp;blanching.</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li><strong>‘Graffiti’</strong>: purple; tends to be milder and sweeter than the white&nbsp;varieties.</li><li><strong>‘Snowball’</strong>:&nbsp;smooth, white, medium 6-inch heads; a good yield throughout the growing&nbsp;season.</li><li>Orange varieties, such as <strong>‘Cheddar’</strong> and <strong>‘Flame Star’</strong>, are creamier and sweeter than white varieties, with more vitamin&nbsp;A.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"cauliflower at a farm stand\" height=\"498\" src=\"/sites/default/files/users/The%20Editors/cauliflower_full_width.jpg\" width=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption><em>Cauliflower at a farm stand in Washington, D.C., 2019</em>.&nbsp;<br><em>Credit: Wendy Hagen</em>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest block--field-blocknodeplantfield-harvest flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-harvest field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Harvesting</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                            \n        <ul><li>Plants are usually ready to harvest in about 50 to 100 days, depending on variety, or 7 to 12 days after&nbsp;blanching.</li><li>When the heads are compact, white, and firm, then it is time to harvest them.

They came out great and all I did was water daily and feed once a month. Big beautiful snowwhite heads about 4 pounds each. And they are delicious! Almost better raw than cooked.\r\nI know they only produce a single flower, but after harvesting them, I cut and sauteed some of the leaves......and they were delicious,  too!! Kinda like a mix of chard and kale. They were still firm and not mushy like sauteed spinach. I will try some of the stalks, too.\r\nJust thought I'd share that if you grow it, then you can eat everything.  0 waste.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-115745\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"114883\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Karen Sapper&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Fri, 12/18/2020 - 12:32</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"114883\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90161\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      I didn't pull up my plants after harvest this year so I could feed the foliage to my chickens.
