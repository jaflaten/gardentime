  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Strawberries\n\n\n### Planting\nStrawberry plants require 6 to 10 hours of direct sunlight a day, so choose a sunny spot. Otherwise, strawberries are tolerant of different soil types, although they prefer loamy soil that drains well. Preparing the Soil for Strawberries To ensure a strong start, add a few buckets of well-rotted manure before planting; you could also use garden compost. If you have clay soil, generally mix in 4 inches or more of compost and rake the clay soil into raised mounds to further improve drainage. If your soil is sandy, simply cultivate lightly to remove weeds and mix in a 1-inch layer of rich compost or rotted manure. Soil pH should be between 5.5 and 7. If necessary, amend your soil before planting. If soils in your area are naturally alkaline, it is best to grow strawberries in half-barrels or other large containers filled with compost-enriched potting soil. Raised beds are a particularly good option for strawberry plants. Practice crop rotation for the most success. Unless you plan to amend your soil each year, do not plant in a site that recently had tomatoes, peppers, or eggplant. Also, note that strawberries and garlic are good planting companions if you wish to interplant. Garlic helps deter pests like spider mites. When to Plant Strawberries Plan to plant when the ground can be worked in the spring. See your local frost dates. Establish new plants each year to maintain high berry quality each season. Strawberry plants will produce runners (daughter plants) that root and grow into new strawberry plants. Buy disease-resistant plants from a reputable nursery, of a variety that is recommended in your area. You can consult with the nursery you buy them from or with your state Cooperative Extension service for locally recommended varieties. You can buy strawberries in pots, but also you can sometimes find bare-root strawberries or runners, which offer really excellent value for money. They look fairly shocking, without any leaves and rather scraggly, but don’t let that put you off. Once they hit the soil, they’ll be well away! How to Plant Strawberries Provide adequate space for sprawling. Allow for spacing of around 18 inches (1-1/2 feet) to leave room for runners and leave 4 feet between rows. Strawberries are sprawling plants. Seedlings will send out runners, which, in turn, will send out their own runners. (Container strawberries can be planted closer together.) Plant holes should be deep and wide enough to accommodate the entire root system without bending it. However, don’t plant too deep! The roots should be covered, but the crown should be right at the soil surface. It is very important that you do NOT bury the crown (central growing bud) of the plant, or it could rot. The leaves, flowers, and fruit must be exposed to light and fresh air. To settle their roots into the soil, water plants well at the time of planting. Use a mulch of the strawberry’s namesake – straw! It is also possible to grow strawberries from last year’s runners. See this video to find out how. Planting Strawberries in Containers Potted strawberries are easy to get right. They go in at the same depth as the potting mix in the container, but for bare-rooted plants, make sure you don’t go too deep or too shallow. If too deep, the plant may struggle and could potentially rot away. If it is too shallow, it will rock about and dry out really easily, creating a weak and brittle plant. You want the crown of the plant where the stems of the leaves emerge to be ever so slightly proud of the soil surface. Learn more about growing strawberries in pots.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Strawberries\n\n\n### Growing\nHow to Grow Strawberries The big tip with strawberries is to keep them well watered while they are establishing their roots and during dry weather. Moisture is incredibly important due to its shallow roots. Water adequately, about one inch per square foot per week. Strawberry plants need a lot of water when the runners and flowers are developing and again in the late summer when the plants are fully mature and gearing up for winter dormancy. Keep strawberry beds mulched to reduce water needs and weed invasion. Any type of mulch—from black plastic to pine straw to shredded leaves—will keep the soil moist and the plants clean. Read more about mulching. Be diligent about weeding—weed by hand, especially in the first months after planting. Once strawberries flower, fertilize them with a high-potassium, liquid tomato feed to encourage good fruit production. Plants also benefit from the addition of an organic, general-purpose fertilizer early in spring, as they set into growth, to help power things up for the new season. In the first year, pick off blossoms to discourage strawberry plants from fruiting. If not allowed to bear fruit, they will spend their food reserves on developing healthy roots instead, which is a good thing. The yields will be much greater in the second year. Eliminate runner plants as needed. First and second generations produce higher yields. Try to keep daughter plants spaced about 10 inches apart. Row covers are a good option for protecting blossoms and fruit from birds. Photo by Yuriy S./Getty Images Winter Care of Strawberries Strawberry plants are perennial. They are naturally cold-hardy and will survive mildly freezing temperatures. So, if your area has mild winters, little care is needed. In regions where the temperature regularly drops into the low twenties (Fahrenheit), strawberries will be in their dormant stage. It’s best to provide some winter protection: When the growing season is over, mow or cut foliage down to one inch. This can be done after the first couple of frosts or when air temps reach 20°F (-6°C). Mulch plants about 4 inches deep with straw, pine needles, or other organic material. In even colder regions, more insulating mulch should be added. Natural precipitation should appropriately maintain sufficient soil moisture. Remove mulch in early spring after the danger of frost has passed. How to Propagate Strawberries Strawberries produce long, wiry stems called runners with little plantlets along them. You can use these to grow more strawberries by just pinning the plantlets down to the root and then severing them from the mother plant once they have. See our article for details on how to grow more strawberries!\n\n### Winter Care of Strawberries\nStrawberry plants are perennial.

  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Strawberries\n\n\n### Harvesting\nHow to Harvest Strawberries When you grow your own, you can peak at the peak of ripeness. No more white strawberries! Harvest only fully red (ripe) berries, and pick every three days. Fruit is typically ready for harvesting 4 to 6 weeks after blossoming. Ideally, pick fruits in the warmth of the afternoon for maximum flavor. Cut by the stem; do not pull the berry, or you could damage the plant. For June-bearer strawberries, the harvest will last up to 3 weeks. Depending on the variety, you should have an abundance of berries. How to Store Strawberries Store unwashed berries in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. Strawberries can be frozen whole for about 2 months. Dehydrate them or turn them into delicious jams.

Netting is one option to physically keep them off developing fruits; make sure it’s in place before the fruits start to swell and color up. The other pest to watch out for is slugs. Set up slug traps among your plants or, for more organic slug-control tips, use beer traps. Spread sand over the strawberry bed to deter slugs (This also works well for lettuce). Pine needles also foil slug and pill-bug damage. For bigger bugs such as Japanese beetles, spray your plants with puréed garlic and neem seed oil. The other thing to watch out for is frost early on in the season when plants are flowering. Strawberries are super-hardy, but if a frost gets at the flowers, they’ll turn to a blackened mush and won’t be viable. So, cover flowering plants with row covers or cloches should a frosty night threaten.\n\n### Pest-Beating Tips\n- Watch out for birds!

<p>You&#8217;ll never find that sweet strawberry taste as good as the one you&#8217;ve grown yourself or picked from a farm. Why? The sugar in berries converts to starch soon after they&#8217;re picked. Learn more about how to grow strawberries in your garden or&nbsp;containers.</p><h2>About Strawberry&nbsp;Plants</h2><p>Garden strawberries are typically much sweeter and juicier than those found in grocery stores. They are also perennials, so they&#8217;ll come back year after year! Plus, they grow easily wherever there is outdoor space and in almost any climate or soil, from garden beds to pots to hanging&nbsp;baskets.</p><h3>Strawberry Plants Come in Four&nbsp;Types</h3><ul><li><strong>June-bearing strawberries bear fruit in one go, usually over a period of three&nbsp;weeks.&nbsp;</strong>The berries tend to be larger. Despite their name, you can choose from early-, mid-, and late-season varieties that fruit anytime from early to late summer.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Everbearing strawberries (also called perpetual or all-season strawberries) produce steadily throughout the summer and even into autumn.</strong> They have smaller berries and are great for making jam or freezing.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Day-neutral strawberries (closely related to everbearers) also produce fruit continuously throughout the season.</strong> Insensitive to day length, these varieties produce buds, fruits, and runners continuously if the temperature remains between 35° and 85°F (1° to 30°C). Production is less than that of June-bearers.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alpine Strawberries: In a little world of their own are the alpine and wild strawberries. </strong>These are much smaller plants that form far smaller berries, but they have an almost impossibly intense flavor – perfect for topping your morning cereal, for example! They require less attention than bigger strawberry plants and, once established, will pretty much look after themselves, making an attractive edging plant or even growing out from the cracks or walls.<br>They will naturally self-seed to create a useful edible ground&nbsp;cover.</li></ul><p>For the home garden, we recommend <strong>June-bearers</strong>. Although you will have to wait a year for fruit harvesting, it will be well worth&nbsp;it.</p><table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext

           \n        <p>Strawberry plants require 6 to 10 hours of direct sunlight a day, so choose a sunny spot. Otherwise, strawberries are tolerant of different soil types, although they prefer loamy soil that drains&nbsp;well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Preparing the Soil for&nbsp;Strawberries</h3><p>To ensure a strong start, add a few buckets of well-rotted manure before planting; you could also use garden compost. If you have clay soil, generally mix in 4 inches or more of compost and rake the clay soil into raised mounds to further improve drainage. If your soil is sandy, simply cultivate lightly to remove weeds and mix in a 1-inch layer of rich compost or rotted&nbsp;manure.</p><p>Soil pH should be between 5.5 and 7. If necessary, <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/preparing-soil-planting\">amend your soil</a> before planting.&nbsp;If soils in your area are naturally alkaline, it is best to grow strawberries in half-barrels or other large containers filled with compost-enriched potting soil. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/how-build-raised-garden-bed\">Raised beds</a> are a particularly good option for strawberry&nbsp;plants.</p><p>Practice crop rotation for the most success. Unless you plan to amend your soil each year, do not plant in a site that recently had <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/tomatoes\">tomatoes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/bell-peppers\">peppers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/eggplant\">eggplant</a>.</p><p>Also, note that strawberries and garlic are good <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/companion-planting-guide-vegetables\">planting companions</a> if you wish to interplant. Garlic helps deter pests like spider&nbsp;mites.&nbsp;</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Strawberries</h3><ul><li>Plan to plant when the ground can be worked in the spring. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates\">See your local frost dates</a>.</li><li>Establish new plants each year to maintain high berry quality each season. Strawberry plants will produce runners (daughter plants) that root and grow into new strawberry&nbsp;plants.</li><li>Buy disease-resistant plants from a reputable nursery, of a variety that is recommended in your area. You can consult with the nursery you buy them from or with your state <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/content/cooperative-extension-services\">Cooperative Extension service</a>&nbsp;for locally recommended&nbsp;varieties.</li><li>You can buy strawberries in pots, but also you can sometimes find bare-root strawberries or runners, which offer really excellent value for money. They look fairly shocking, without any leaves and rather scraggly, but don’t let that put you off. Once they hit the soil, they’ll be well&nbsp;away!&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://gardenplanner.almanac.com/\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/users/Almanac%20Staff/growveg_strawberry.jpeg\" alt=\"Spacing for Strawberries\" width=\"720\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Strawberries</h3><ul><li>Provide adequate space for sprawling. Allow for spacing of around 18&nbsp;inches (1-1/2 feet) to leave room for runners and leave 4 feet between rows.&nbsp;Strawberries are sprawling plants. Seedlings will send out runners, which, in turn, will send out their own runners. (Container strawberries can be planted closer&nbsp;together.)</li><li>Plant holes should be deep and wide enough to accommodate the entire root system without bending it. However, don’t plant too deep! The roots should be covered, but the crown should be right at the soil surface. It is very important that you&nbsp;do <span class=\"caps\">NOT</span> bury the crown (central growing bud) of the plant, or it could rot.&nbsp;The leaves, flowers, and fruit must be exposed to light and fresh&nbsp;air. </li><li>To settle their roots into the soil, water plants well at the time of&nbsp;planting.</li><li>Use a mulch of the strawberry’s namesake –&nbsp;straw! </li><li>It is also possible to grow strawberries from last year’s runners. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-grow-strawberries-runners\">See this video to find out how</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Planting Strawberries in&nbsp;Containers</h3><p>Potted strawberries are easy to get right. They go in at the same depth as the potting mix in the container, but for bare-rooted plants, make sure you don’t go too deep or too shallow. If too deep, the plant may struggle and could potentially rot away. If it is too shallow, it will rock about and dry out really easily, creating a weak and brittle plant. You want the crown of the plant where the stems of the leaves emerge to be ever so slightly proud of the soil surface. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/growing-strawberries-containers\">Learn more about growing strawberries in pots</a>.</p><p><strong>Watch this video to see how to plant strawberries in garden beds or&nbsp;containers.</strong></p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MKkBy93yqA?si=eW8ty_1lvCOjvqN_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n        <h3>How to&nbsp;Grow&nbsp;Strawberries</h3><ul><li>The big tip with strawberries is to keep them well watered while they are establishing their roots and during dry weather. Moisture is incredibly important due to its shallow roots. Water adequately, about one inch per square foot per week. Strawberry plants&nbsp;need a lot of water when the runners and flowers are developing and again in the late summer when the plants are fully mature and gearing up for winter&nbsp;dormancy.</li><li>Keep strawberry beds mulched to reduce water needs and weed invasion. Any type of mulch—from black plastic to pine straw to shredded leaves—will keep the soil moist and the plants clean. <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/news/gardening/gardening-advice/mulching-guide-benefits-mulch\">Read more about mulching</a>.</li><li>Be diligent about weeding—weed by hand, especially in the first months after&nbsp;planting.</li><li>Once strawberries flower, fertilize them with a high-potassium, liquid tomato feed to encourage good fruit production. Plants also benefit from the addition of an organic, general-purpose fertilizer early in spring, as they set into growth, to help power things up for the new&nbsp;season.</li><li>In the first year, pick off blossoms to discourage strawberry plants from fruiting. If not allowed to bear fruit, they will spend their food reserves on developing healthy roots instead, which is a good thing. The yields will be much greater in the second&nbsp;year.</li><li>Eliminate <a href=\"https://harvestny.cce.cornell.edu/uploads/doc_219.pdf\">runner plants</a> as needed. First and second generations produce higher yields. Try to keep daughter plants spaced about 10 inches&nbsp;apart.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/video/how-make-row-cover-tunnel\">Row covers</a> are a good option for protecting blossoms and fruit from&nbsp;birds.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"Strawberries.

They are naturally cold-hardy and will survive mildly freezing temperatures. So, if your area has mild winters, little care is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>In regions where the temperature regularly drops into the low twenties (Fahrenheit), strawberries will be in their dormant stage. It’s best to provide some winter&nbsp;protection:</p><ul><li>When the growing season is over, mow or cut foliage down to one inch. This can be done after the first couple of frosts or when air temps reach 20°F&nbsp;(-6°C).</li><li>Mulch plants about 4 inches deep with straw, pine needles, or other organic&nbsp;material.</li><li>In even&nbsp;colder regions, more insulating mulch should be&nbsp;added.&nbsp; </li><li>Natural precipitation should appropriately maintain sufficient soil&nbsp;moisture.&nbsp; </li><li>Remove mulch in early spring after the danger of frost has&nbsp;passed.</li></ul><h3>How to Propagate&nbsp;Strawberries</h3><p>Strawberries produce long, wiry stems called runners with little plantlets along them. You can use these to grow more strawberries by just pinning the plantlets down to the root and then severing them from the mother plant once they have.

Netting is one option to physically keep them off developing fruits; make sure it’s in place before the fruits start to swell and color&nbsp;up.</li><li>The other pest to watch out for is slugs. Set up slug traps among your plants or, for more organic slug-control tips, use beer traps. Spread sand over the strawberry bed to deter slugs (This also works well for <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/lettuce\">lettuce</a>). Pine needles also foil slug and pill-bug&nbsp;damage.</li><li>For bigger bugs such as Japanese beetles, spray your plants with puréed garlic and neem seed&nbsp;oil.</li><li>The other thing to watch out for is frost early on in the season when plants are flowering. Strawberries are super-hardy, but if a frost gets at the flowers, they’ll turn to a blackened mush and won’t be viable.

For 2 years I had  nice  strawberries plants in a raised  bed,  I never  cut them back . We put straw over the beds for the winter. Well, we took the straws off and I  don't have any plants. It look like  something went under the hay( straw)  ate the greens off it all. I hope the  roots  are still there. There  is no hole in the ground. Can you tell me what happened?

That must have been a disappointing discovery. While most of the pests that harm strawberry plants are insects, they would not have eaten the plants down to the soil. You certainly had some hungry (and stealth) critters around your property that took an extreme liking to your strawberry plants. Whether your crowns remain in tact for future growth or you plant new strawberries for next year, it might be a good idea to put up some sort of fencing or barrier around your raised beds as a deterrent.</p><p>While this does not sound like the case with your strawberries, since you said that you never cut back your strawberries, this is a good opportunity to mention that after harvesting your crop, it is best to cut back the foliage to 1-inch above the ground. This helps to remove older leaves that could be infected with diseases and control insects by removing their food source and potential breeding sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-129102\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"118264\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Ane&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Fri, 06/04/2021 - 13:58</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"118264\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90277\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      It is funny that altho I have a compulsion to put things in rows and keep everything to a minimum, I don't plant that way.  Why? Because nature doesn't plant that way.  I have waist high planters and 16 inch pots that hold everything.  My strawberries had the last three months in shade because I hadn't gotten the lay of the land in my front yard.  They will probably be sent to the back deck soon as the old tree in the front has decided to spread more this year.  They are crowded, no mulch, and producing like they are very happy.  I don't keep the runners cause they are not as vigorous as the mother plants and over time will revert to the original berry species.  But they do look pretty hanging over the side of the pot.  It's funny how all the sites say the same thing, I have never paid attention and currently have enough strawberries to make a pie with rhubarb I found at the local market... these are day neutral...good times \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-118264\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"117325\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;John Nashman&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 04/10/2021 - 07:11</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"117325\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90277\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      i grow hydroponically everything from tomatoes to lettuce in perlite with nutrients  can you grow strawberry's \r\nin perlite    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-117325\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"125989\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Jennaay&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Tue, 09/20/2022 - 15:20</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"125989\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90277\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      Can I grow the runners indoors once I've cut them off?

Depending on your type of plant, it may continue to bloom and grow berries. I had a new deck built, strawberries were growing around support posts and had to be removed during construction. I removed and potted all. Put a baby runner in a single pot and the remaining bunch of plants in a huge pot. All are indoor since construction continued into December. I'm hoping all survive through winter till spring so I can transplant. Good luck with your strawberries. I bought a really hardy everberring plant. It's continuing to ripen fruit in front of patio door. I'm amazed that the original plant and the dozen of runner plants did so well.\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-132215\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"117146\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Dee&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 03/27/2021 - 06:48</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"117146\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"90277\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      My strawberry bed is over ten years old,\r\nold plants are replaced by new runners and produce nice size fruit,\r\nhowever two years ago I started noticing new strawberry plants but they're like wild ones.\r\nThey have tiny little berries and have spread all over.\r\nI've tried pulling out those runners but can't get them all.\r\nI'm afraid they will choke out my real plants.\r\nHow do I rid my garden of these wild ones?\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-117146\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"124387\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Candace M.
