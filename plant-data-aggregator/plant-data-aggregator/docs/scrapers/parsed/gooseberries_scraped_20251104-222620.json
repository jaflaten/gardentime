  "plantingGuide" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Gooseberries for a Sweet and Tangy Treat\n\n\n### Planting\nGooseberries aren’t fussy, but they’ll grow and yield best in a sunny position in rich, well-draining soil. The plant will naturally grow into vigorous bushes, but they may also be trained as standards on a long single trunk or against a fence as fans or single-stemmed cordons. They can be successfully grown in containers, too. When to Plant Gooseberries Plant bare-root or container-grown gooseberries from late fall to early spring, any time the ground isn’t frozen solid. Southern gardeners should do fall planting, allowing the plant to establish itself without worrying about hot summer weather stressing the plants. If you buy bare-root plants, they can and should be planted as soon as possible after receiving them. Dormant gooseberries (no leaves yet) can be planted in spring as soon as the soil can be worked. How to Plant Gooseberries Both will grow well, but bare-root plants may be significantly less expensive and often grow better in the first year than potted plants. For bare-root plants, soak the roots in a bucket of water for 12 hours or so before planting—don’t let them dry out. I keep them in the bucket and take them to the planting site. Dig a generous planting hole twice as wide as the root ball and about as deep. If planting bare-root shrubs, you’ll likely be able to see the old soil line on the trunk as a discoloration. The hole should look like a shallow bowl with sloping sides, not a coffee cup. Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole. Either dig and refill it or use a garden fork to work it. Mix well-rotted compost or manure with the excavated soil. Try to avoid having a hard surface at the edge of the hole, which can be challenging for new roots to penetrate. Lightly water the soil in the hole before planting. Cut any circling or girdling roots. Use a garden trowel or soil knife to loosen up root-bound plants by scoring the edges of the rootball (container plants only). Test fit the shrub in the hole and adjust the depth as necessary. Match the old soil level or soil line on the stem with your new ground level. Plant the shrub, spreading the roots out evenly. Don’t leave them in a cluster or clump. Backfill the hole with the soil you removed. Pause partway and water well, then continue adding soil. Firm the soil around the roots to avoid air pockets. Make sure to keep the shrub upright and not tilted to one side. Form a slight lip of soil, about a foot in diameter, around the plant to hold water from flowing away, then water again. Mulch underneath to keep weeds down and keep the soil moist. Apply a 2- to 3-inch-thick layer, but don’t allow the mulch to contact the trunk(s). Keep it a finger width or two clear.

  "careInstructions" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Gooseberries for a Sweet and Tangy Treat\n\n\n### Growing\nKeep your gooseberry bushes well-watered while they’re young or if they’re growing in containers. Established gooseberry bushes need very little watering, unless your climate is hot and dry. At the end of each winter, use a balanced organic fertilizer. Otherwise, do not fertilize. These bushes are scrappy, and too much fertilizer can cause problems. Remove any weeds around the root area before topping up with a thick layer of organic matter, such as garden compost or bark chippings. Spread the mulch 4 to 6 inches thick around the bush and out to the drip line. Don’t pile mulch up against the shrub’s base. Prevent birds from stealing your gooseberries by covering bushes with netting (or grow them inside a purpose-made fruit cage). Pruning Gooseberry Shrubs With gooseberries, annual pruning is recommended to keep the shrub neat and accessible, but it won’t need much else once established. Prune in late winter while the plants are still dormant. Remove any dead or broken branches first. Next, prune to open the center, removing twisted or competing branches. Suckers coming from the base can also be pruned. Finally, trim back last year’s growth by about half. Locate your cuts immediately above a bud.

  "harvestInfo" : "### Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Gooseberries for a Sweet and Tangy Treat\n\n\n### Harvesting\nBe patient: First berries start ripening in the early summer of the plant’s second year; expect full fruit 3 to 5 years later. We harvest in midsummer, though it depends on your climate. The easiest way to determine if gooseberries are ripe is to gently squeeze them. The fruits are soft, so handle them gently and wear thick gloves if your bush is thorny. To get the hang of it, start when they are still immature. The fruits will feel quite firm. As they ripen, they’ll feel softer, more like a grape. Varieties other than green will also start to change color. Note: Not all gooseberries on a bush will be ripe simultaneously—the window usually lasts several weeks. Harvest dessert or dual-purpose varieties in stages. For fresh eating, pick at the peak of ripeness—the gooseberries will separate easily from the stems. If you have to tug at it, leave it another day or two. The underripe fruits are ideal for cooking, and riper fruits will be sweeter and larger. Store freshly picked gooseberries in the refrigerator; they should last about a week, though they are best eaten right away, like raspberries!\n\n### How to Grow Pomegranate Trees: Planting, Care, and Harvesting Tips\n",

Whether you’re dreaming of gooseberry jam or just want a low-maintenance fruit bush in your yard, this tart-sweet berry is a perfect pick. From planting tips to harvest tricks, we’ve got your gooseberry journey covered. Let’s grow&nbsp;gooseberries!</p><h2>About&nbsp;Gooseberries</h2><p>A tasty treat that is hard to find in stores, gooseberries are a reward reserved for gardeners. Most major seed companies carry gooseberry plants. They’re often sold as bare-root plants but also as potted&nbsp;plants.</p><p>Gooseberries are very popular in England and Europe, but they were banned at the turn of the century in North America because they (and <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/plant/currants\">currants</a>) could host white pine blister rust. However, the bans have now been lifted for all but a few states, and disease-resistant gooseberry varieties are available. We’re happy to see these sweet-tart berries are making a&nbsp;comeback.&nbsp;</p><p>Gooseberries are members of the genus&nbsp;<em>Ribes</em>&nbsp;(family Grossulariaceae),&nbsp;cultivated&nbsp;for their edible berries and as ornamental shrubs. They tend to be a little smaller than a grape, and their color can range from pale green to yellow to red. Their taste is a mix of blueberry, kiwi, and grape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The varieties are usually described as either culinary or dessert. Culinary gooseberries are often cooked into jellies, pies, cobblers, and other desserts with sugar. Dessert varieties are sweet enough to eat straight from the bush, but they’re also great for&nbsp;cooking.&nbsp;</p><p>Gooseberry bushes grow well in most soils, are easy to prune, and are very high-yielding. They are self-pollinating, so you only need one to produce fruit. Each gooseberry bush produces about 10 pounds of fruit per&nbsp;year.&nbsp;</p><p>Gooseberries are also a prolific choice for northern gardeners who can’t grow those juicy warm-weather fruits. Most varieties are cold-hardy down to <span class=\"caps\">USDA</span> Zone 3, and some survive in Zone 2. If you’ve always wanted fruit trees and not bushes, many train well as “standards,” which is nursery speak for a bush that is trained into tree form with a single stem, like a rose&nbsp;tree.</p><p>Here’s another benefit! Gooseberries are considered a “superfruit,” as the berries are high in nutrients and low in calories. This fruit is also high in fiber, potassium, and vitamins A and C, and is rich in&nbsp;antioxidants.</p><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"red goosberries on a bush\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7bfe140f-3b84-4eb7-b1fd-3f9fcc168089\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/images/gooseberries-shutterstock_1458321413.jpg\" width=\"2048\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Gooseberries come in green varieties or you can grow sweeter red varieties.

The plant will naturally grow into vigorous bushes, but they may also be trained as standards on a long single trunk or against a fence as fans or single-stemmed cordons. They can be successfully grown in containers,&nbsp;too.</p><h3>When to Plant&nbsp;Gooseberries</h3><p>Plant bare-root or container-grown gooseberries from late fall to early spring, any time the ground isn’t frozen solid. Southern gardeners should do fall planting, allowing the plant to establish itself without worrying about hot summer weather stressing the&nbsp;plants.&nbsp;</p><p>If you buy bare-root plants, they can and should be planted as soon as possible after receiving them. Dormant gooseberries (no leaves yet) can be planted in spring as soon as the soil can be&nbsp;worked.</p><h3>How to Plant&nbsp;Gooseberries</h3><p>Both will grow well, but bare-root plants may be significantly less expensive and often grow better in the first year than potted&nbsp;plants.&nbsp;</p><p>For bare-root plants, soak the roots in a bucket of water for 12 hours or so before planting—don’t let them dry out. I keep them in the bucket and take them to the planting&nbsp;site.</p><ul><li>Dig a generous planting hole twice as wide as the root ball and about as deep. If planting bare-root shrubs, you’ll likely be able to see the old soil line on the trunk as a discoloration. The hole should look like a shallow bowl with sloping sides, not a coffee cup.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Loosen the soil at the bottom of the hole. Either dig and refill it or use a garden fork to work it. Mix well-rotted compost or manure with the excavated soil.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Try to avoid having a hard surface at the edge of the hole, which can be challenging for new roots to penetrate.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Lightly water the soil in the hole before planting.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Cut any circling or girdling roots. Use a garden trowel or soil knife to loosen up root-bound plants by scoring the edges of the rootball (container plants only).<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Test fit the shrub in the hole and adjust the depth as necessary. Match the old soil level or soil line on the stem with your new ground level.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Plant the shrub, spreading the roots out evenly. Don’t leave them in a cluster or clump.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Backfill the hole with the soil you removed. Pause partway and water well, then continue adding soil. Firm the soil around the roots to avoid air pockets. Make sure to keep the shrub upright and not tilted to one side.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Form a slight lip of soil, about a foot in diameter, around the plant to hold water from flowing away, then water again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Mulch underneath to keep weeds down and keep the soil moist. Apply a 2- to 3-inch-thick layer, but don’t allow the mulch to contact the trunk(s). Keep it a finger width or two&nbsp;clear.</li></ul><figure role=\"group\">\n<img alt=\"green gooseberries\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"435e2d6a-e630-41bc-bd54-1013d2c6ba98\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/images/gooseberries-green-shutterstock_1789870895.jpg\" width=\"2000\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Credit: Iryna80</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"body-ad-wrapper block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield-care block--field-blocknodeplantfield-care flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-care field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Growing</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n        <p>Keep your gooseberry bushes well-watered while they’re young or if they’re growing in containers. Established gooseberry bushes need very little watering, unless your climate is hot and&nbsp;dry.</p><p>At the end of each winter, use a balanced organic fertilizer. Otherwise, do not fertilize. These bushes are scrappy, and too much fertilizer can cause&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Remove any weeds around the root area before topping up with a thick layer of organic matter, such as garden compost or bark&nbsp;chippings.</p><p>Spread the mulch 4 to 6 inches thick around the bush and out to the drip line. Don’t pile mulch up against the shrub&#8217;s&nbsp;base.</p><p>Prevent birds from stealing your gooseberries by covering bushes with netting (or grow them inside a purpose-made fruit&nbsp;cage).</p><h3>Pruning Gooseberry&nbsp;Shrubs</h3><p>With gooseberries, annual pruning is recommended to keep the shrub neat and accessible, but it won’t need much else once&nbsp;established.&nbsp;</p><p>Prune in late winter while the plants are still&nbsp;dormant.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Remove any dead or broken branches first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Next, prune to open the center, removing twisted or competing branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Suckers coming from the base can also be pruned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, trim back last year’s growth by about half. Locate your cuts immediately above a&nbsp;bud.</li></ul><h3>Video Demo: How to Grow&nbsp;Gooseberries</h3><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZ7p-YLS0po?si=5bAqvSLc1_wEY4A4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"plain-text block block-layout-builder block-field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended block--field-blocknodeplantfield__recommended flex flex-col\">\n  \n    \n\n            <div class=\"block__content block-content flex flex-col flex-grow\">\n        \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field__recommended field--type-text-long field--label-above clearfix text-formatted\">\n    <h2 class=\"field__label\">Types</h2>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">\n                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n        <p>Some varieties are virtually thornless, and it’s important to choose a variety that is resistant to disease, mildew, and&nbsp;pests.</p><p>Here are several of the gooseberry varieties that grow in North&nbsp;America.</p><ul><li>‘Oregon Champion’ produces medium-size to large yellow-green berries that work well for processing; canes are thornless; 3 to 5 feet tall; hardy in Zones 3 to 8; quite resistant to powdery mildew.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>‘Poorman’ is dessert quality; it&#8217;s very productive, with red-fruited, flavorful, large fruit, and is the best variety for the home garden.

The easiest way to determine if gooseberries are ripe is to gently squeeze them. The fruits are soft, so handle them gently and wear thick gloves if your bush is&nbsp;thorny.</li><li>To get the hang of it, start when they are still immature. The fruits will feel quite firm. As they ripen, they’ll feel softer, more like a grape.

Since planting them in 2019 (or even earlier?), I have not been able to enjoy even one bowl of gooseberries. Pretty much every single berry has had a currant sawfly larva in it. Added protein, I know, but not very appetizing. \r\n\r\nI had no idea that this could even be a problem. I feel terrible -- I waited to long for them to start producing, and then when I noticed the problem, I invested a lot of time and energy into trying prevent the sawflies from taking over, including putting row cover on them, kaolin, picking off the adorable green worms and feeding them to my neighbors' chickens... And all for naught. \r\n\r\nBut apparently I just have bad luck. When researching the matter, I read that someone here locally (I live on Puget Sound in Washington State) had such a bad infestation of currant sawflies that he had to rip out all his plants, but that just a couple of miles away his friend had no problem with his bushes. \r\n\r\nI thought about giving away the bushes to someone who lives elsewhere, but wondered whether really it was safe, even if I get all the dirt off -- my master gardener friend confirmed my fear: she said it is best to destroy them, since the risk would be too great that I would spread the sawflies even farther. \r\n\r\nI assume that my problem might have to do with the fact that I have native currants as well. In any case, I was surprised that the Almanac article didn't mention a word about the devastating currant sawflies! \r\n\r\nI guess I could try to have just one currant bush, symbolically, to remind me of my dear Warsaw landlady's impressive row of red, black and white currants in her Grochów garden -- but unfortunately even trying to keep the sawflies away from that one bush would probably be incredibly aggravating.  \r\n\r\nBest to save my sanity and grow some native, problem-free, delicious blackcaps.  :-)\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-131956\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"134948\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Aimee&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 07/13/2024 - 11:45</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"134948\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"475875\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      PS - Our gooseberries are in our ‘fruit forest’ understory we planted, along with native red flowering currants, clove currants, and pink champagne currants, all which are doing well. \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-reply-form-wrapper\" id=\"comment-reply-form-134948\" style=\"display: none;\">\n      <div class=\"reply-form-header\">\n        <h4>Reply to comment</h4>\n        <button class=\"reply-form-close\" aria-label=\"Close reply form\">×</button>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"reply-form-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </article>\n</div>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"views-row\"><div class=\"comment-wrapper comments-tailwind\">\n  <article class=\"js-comment comment-form-styled\" data-comment-id=\"134947\">\n    <div class=\"comment-header\">\n      <div class=\"attribution\">\n                  <span class=\"user-picture-circle\"><article>\n  </article>\n</span>\n                <span class=\"comment-author\">&lt;span&gt;Aimee&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"comment-time\">Sat, 07/13/2024 - 11:44</span>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-actions\">\n        <button class=\"comment-reply-link\"\n                data-comment-id=\"134947\"\n                data-entity-type=\"node\"\n                data-entity-id=\"475875\"\n                data-field-name=\"comment_node_plant\"\n                aria-label=\"Reply to this comment\">Reply</button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"comment-body\">\n      We live in Skagit Valley north of Puget Sound and I’d never had great luck with gooseberries in the past due to pests until I got the Oregon Champion variety over at Christianson’s Nursery.
