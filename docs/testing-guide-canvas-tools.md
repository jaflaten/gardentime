**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the newly implemented canvas drawing features.

## Prerequisites

1. **Backend Running:** Spring Boot server on `localhost:8080`
2. **Frontend Running:** Next.js dev server on `localhost:3000`
3. **Logged In:** Have a user account and be logged in
4. **Garden Created:** Have at least one garden to work with

---

## Test 1: Drawing Basic Shapes

### Rectangle Tool
1. Navigate to a garden detail page (board view)
2. Click the **Rectangle** tool (icon: ‚ñ≠, shortcut: `3`)
3. Click and drag on the canvas to draw a rectangle
4. Release mouse - rectangle should be saved and appear in the view
5. **Expected:** Rectangle appears with black border, transparent fill

### Circle Tool
1. Click the **Circle** tool (icon: ‚óã, shortcut: `4`)
2. Click and drag on the canvas
3. Release mouse
4. **Expected:** Perfect circle appears with black border, transparent fill

### Line Tool
1. Click the **Line** tool (icon: ‚îÄ, shortcut: `5`)
2. Click and drag to draw a line
3. Release mouse
4. **Expected:** Straight line appears between start and end points

### Arrow Tool
1. Click the **Arrow** tool (icon: ‚Üí, shortcut: `6`)
2. Click and drag to draw an arrow
3. Release mouse
4. **Expected:** Arrow appears with arrowhead pointing toward the end point

## Test 2: Shift Key Modifiers

### Perfect Squares (Rectangle + Shift)
1. Select Rectangle tool (`3`)
2. Start dragging to draw a rectangle
3. **While still dragging, press and hold Shift**
4. **Expected:** Rectangle should instantly snap to a perfect square
5. **Move mouse while holding Shift** - should remain a square
6. **Release Shift** (still dragging) - should return to rectangle
7. **Press Shift again** - back to square
8. Release mouse to save

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úì Shape instantly changes to square when Shift is pressed
- ‚úì Shape returns to rectangle when Shift is released
- ‚úì Works smoothly during dragging
- ‚úì Square maintains aspect ratio in all drag directions

### 45¬∞ Angle Constraints (Line + Shift)
1. Select Line tool (`5`)
2. Start dragging to draw a line
3. **While still dragging, press and hold Shift**
4. **Expected:** Line should snap to nearest 45¬∞ angle (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
5. **Move mouse in a circle while holding Shift**
6. **Expected:** Line should snap through 8 different angles:
   - 0¬∞ (‚Üí horizontal right)
   - 45¬∞ (‚Üó diagonal up-right)
   - 90¬∞ (‚Üë vertical up)
   - 135¬∞ (‚Üñ diagonal up-left)
   - 180¬∞ (‚Üê horizontal left)
   - 225¬∞ (‚Üô diagonal down-left)
   - 270¬∞ (‚Üì vertical down)
   - 315¬∞ (‚Üò diagonal down-right)
7. Release Shift - line should move freely again
8. Release mouse to save

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úì Line snaps to 45¬∞ increments when Shift is held
- ‚úì Snapping feels responsive and natural
- ‚úì All 8 angles are reachable
- ‚úì Line maintains length while snapping

### 45¬∞ Angle Constraints (Arrow + Shift)
1. Select Arrow tool (`6`)
2. Repeat the same test as with lines
3. **Expected:** Same behavior as lines
4. **Additional Check:** Arrowhead should always point in the correct direction

## Test 3: Adjustable Endpoints

### Line Endpoint Editing
1. **Create a line** using the Line tool
2. **Switch to Select tool** (`1` or click SELECT)
3. **Click the line** to select it
4. **Expected:** Two green circular handles appear at each endpoint
5. **Drag the start point handle** to a new location
6. **Expected:** 
   - Handle follows cursor while dragging
   - Line updates in real-time
   - Line is saved when you release
7. **Drag the end point handle** to a different location
8. **Expected:** Same behavior - line updates and saves
9. **Click elsewhere** to deselect
10. **Expected:** Handles disappear

**Visual Check:**
- Handles should be green circles with white borders
- Handles should be easily clickable (6px radius = 12px diameter)
- Line should update smoothly during drag

### Arrow Endpoint Editing
1. **Create an arrow** using the Arrow tool
2. **Select it** with the Select tool
3. **Expected:** Two green handles appear (one at tail, one at arrowhead)
4. **Drag the end point handle** (at arrowhead)
5. **Expected:** 
   - Arrow updates in real-time
   - Arrowhead rotates to point in new direction
   - Arrow is saved when you release
6. **Drag the start point handle** (at tail)
7. **Expected:** Arrow length and angle update

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úì Handles appear on selection
- ‚úì Handles are easily visible and clickable
- ‚úì Dragging is smooth and responsive
- ‚úì Arrow arrowhead points in correct direction after editing
- ‚úì Changes are persisted (refresh page to verify)

## Test 4: Combined Workflow

### Realistic Drawing Scenario
1. **Draw a rectangle** to represent a garden bed
2. **Hold Shift** while dragging to make it a perfect square
3. **Draw another rectangle** nearby (any size)
4. **Draw a line** from the first square to the second rectangle
5. **Hold Shift** to make it horizontal
6. **Release and save the line**
7. **Select the line** and adjust its endpoints to fine-tune the connection
8. **Draw an arrow** pointing to one of the rectangles
9. **Use Shift** to make it point at 45¬∞ angle
10. **Adjust the arrow's start point** to originate from the other rectangle

**Expected Result:**
A simple diagram showing two rectangles connected by a line, with an arrow pointing to one of them.

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úì All shapes draw correctly
- ‚úì Shift modifiers work during initial drawing
- ‚úì Endpoint editing works after creation
- ‚úì All shapes persist after page refresh
- ‚úì Workflow feels natural and efficient

## Test 5: Edge Cases

### Test: Minimum Size Validation
1. Draw a very small rectangle (click and barely move mouse)
2. **Expected:** Should not save (too small to be useful)

### Test: Locked Objects
(This will be testable after properties panel is implemented)
1. Create a line or arrow
2. Lock it via properties panel or database
3. Select it
4. **Expected:** Handles appear but are not draggable

### Test: Zoom and Pan
1. Draw a line at 100% zoom
2. Zoom in to 150%
3. Select the line
4. Drag an endpoint
5. **Expected:** Endpoint editing works correctly at all zoom levels

### Test: Multi-object Selection
1. Draw multiple lines and arrows
2. Select one line
3. **Expected:** Only that line shows endpoint handles
4. Select a different object
5. **Expected:** Handles switch to the newly selected object

---

## Test 6: Keyboard Shortcuts

### Tool Switching
Test each shortcut key:
- `1` = SELECT tool
- `2` = PAN tool
- `3` = RECTANGLE tool
- `4` = CIRCLE tool
- `5` = LINE tool
- `6` = ARROW tool
- `7` = TEXT tool
- `8` = FREEHAND tool

**Expected:** Pressing each number switches to that tool immediately.

### Shift Modifier
- Works during drawing (tested above)
- Should NOT interfere when typing in text fields

---

## Test 7: Error Handling

### Backend Offline
1. Stop the Spring Boot backend server
2. Try to draw a shape
3. **Expected:** Shape appears visually but will fail to save
4. Error should be logged to browser console
5. Restart backend and try again - should work

### Network Issues
1. Use browser DevTools to throttle network to "Slow 3G"
2. Draw several shapes quickly
3. **Expected:** 
   - Shapes appear immediately (optimistic UI)
   - Backend saves may be delayed but should all eventually succeed
   - No errors or failed saves

---

## Test 8: Performance

### Many Objects
1. Draw 20-30 shapes (mix of rectangles, circles, lines, arrows)
2. **Expected:** 
   - Canvas remains responsive
   - Drawing new shapes is still smooth
   - Selecting objects is instant
   - Endpoint dragging is smooth

### Rapid Drawing
1. Select rectangle tool
2. Rapidly draw 10 rectangles in succession
3. **Expected:** 
   - All rectangles appear
   - No visual glitches
   - All rectangles are saved
