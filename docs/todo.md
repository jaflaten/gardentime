# GardenTime - TODO List

## Project Overview
GardenTime is a garden management application that helps users manage multiple gardens with grow zones (planting areas) and track crop rotation to follow regenerative farming principles.

### Core Concepts
- **Garden**: A container for multiple grow zones
- **Grow Zone**: A physical planting area (e.g., 80x120cm box) where crops are planted
- **Crop Record**: Historical record of what was planted in a grow zone (to support crop rotation)
- **Plant**: The type of crop/vegetable/flower that can be grown
