# Step 27.8 - Display Current Crops on Grow Areas

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Date:** October 29, 2025

---

## üéØ Objective

Display current/active crops directly on grow area boxes in the board view, making it easy to see at a glance what's planted where without needing to drill into details.

---

## ‚ú® What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Model Extension

**File:** `client-next/lib/api.ts`

Extended the `GrowArea` interface to include current crops:

```typescript
export interface GrowArea {
  // ... existing fields ...
  // Current crops (Step 27.8)
  currentCrops?: CropRecord[];  // Active crops in this grow area
}
```

This allows grow areas to carry their crop data when fetched from the API.

---

### 2. Crop Data Fetching

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx`

Modified `fetchGardenData()` to load crops for each grow area:

**Key Changes:**
- Import `cropRecordService` from API library
- Fetch crops for each grow area in parallel
- Filter for **active crops only** (PLANTED or GROWING status)
- Graceful error handling (grow areas without crops still work)
- Sort by name for consistent ordering

**Logic:**
```typescript
const growAreasWithCrops = await Promise.all(
  growAreasData.map(async (growArea) => {
    try {
      const crops = await cropRecordService.getByGrowAreaId(growArea.id);
      // Filter for active crops (PLANTED or GROWING status, not HARVESTED)
      const activeCrops = crops.filter(
        (crop) => crop.status === 'PLANTED' || crop.status === 'GROWING' || !crop.status
      );
      return {
        ...growArea,
        currentCrops: activeCrops,
      };
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`Failed to fetch crops for grow area ${growArea.name}:`, err);
      return { ...growArea, currentCrops: [] };
    }
  })
);
```

**Why Filter for Active Crops?**
- We only want to show what's currently planted
- HARVESTED crops are historical data
- DISEASED/FAILED crops might still be "current" (need attention)

---

### 3. Visual Display on Board

**File:** `client-next/app/gardens/[id]/components/GrowAreaBox.tsx`

Added crop display rendering in the Konva Group:

**Features:**
- Shows up to 3 crops with plant names
- Green background badge with shadow
- Status-based color coding
- "+X more" indicator for areas with many crops
- Automatically positioned below grow area name
- Works for both rectangles and circles (buckets)

**Visual Design:**
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ   Grow Area Name    ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Existing
‚îÇ                     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ üå± Tomatoes   ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚Üê NEW: Crop display

```

**Color Coding:**
- **White** - Active crops (PLANTED, GROWING, or no status)
- **Yellow (#fbbf24)** - Harvested crops
- **Red (#ef4444)** - Diseased or failed crops

**Positioning:**
- Centers the crop badge horizontally
- Positions it below the grow area name
- Adapts for both rectangles and circles
- Hides dimensions text when crops are shown (to avoid clutter)

## üìã Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```
GrowAreaBox (Konva Group)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Shape (Rectangle or Circle)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transformer (when selected)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multi-select feedback
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Zone Type Badge
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grow Area Name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ú® Current Crops Display (NEW)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background badge (green, rounded, shadow)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Crop 1 text (üå± Plant Name)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Crop 2 text
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Crop 3 text
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "+X more" text (if > 3 crops)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dimensions text (hidden if crops shown)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Zone size text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Number of rows badge
```

### Visibility Rules

The crop display is shown when:
- `growArea.currentCrops` exists and has length > 0
- Grow area is NOT selected (to avoid clutter with transformer)
- Grow area is NOT being transformed/resized

This ensures the board stays clean and focused.

## üé® Visual Design Choices

### Badge Design
- **Background:** `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.9)` - Emerald green with 90% opacity
- **Corner Radius:** 6px for rounded look
- **Shadow:** Black shadow with 4px blur for depth
- **Size:** 100px wide, height adapts to number of crops (max 80px)

### Text Styling
- **Font Size:** 11px for crop names (readable but compact)
- **Font Weight:** 600 (semi-bold) for emphasis
- **Emoji:** üå± prefix for visual plant indication
- **Truncation:** Text wraps to fit, ellipsis if too long

### Layout Positioning
- **X Position:** Centered horizontally (width/2 - 50)
- **Y Position:** Below name + 25px offset
- **Spacing:** 18px between crop lines
- **Max Display:** 3 crops + "+X more" indicator

## üéØ User Experience

### Before
- No way to see crops on board view
- Had to click into each grow area to see what's planted
- Board was purely positional/organizational

### After
- Immediate visibility of what's growing where
- Color-coded status at a glance
- Can plan based on what's already planted
- Board becomes a living garden map

### Use Cases
1. **Planning New Plantings**
   - "This bed already has tomatoes, I'll plant basil next to it"
   - See companion planting opportunities

2. **Crop Rotation**
   - Quickly see what crop families are where
   - Plan next season's rotation

3. **Garden Overview**
   - See entire garden status at once
   - Identify empty grow areas

4. **Maintenance**
   - See diseased/failed crops (red indicator)
   - Know which areas need attention

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Display Active Crops
**Steps:**
1. Create a grow area
2. Add 1-2 crops with PLANTED or GROWING status
3. Switch to board view
4. Verify crops appear on the grow area box

**Expected:**
- Green badge appears below grow area name
- Crop names show with üå± emoji
- White text for active crops

---

### Test 2: Many Crops Indicator
**Steps:**
1. Create a grow area
2. Add 5 crops with PLANTED status
3. Switch to board view
4. Verify "+2 more" indicator appears

**Expected:**
- Shows first 3 crops
- "+2 more" text appears at bottom of badge
- Badge height adapts (max 80px)

---

### Test 3: Status Color Coding
**Steps:**
1. Create crops with different statuses:
   - Crop 1: PLANTED (should be white)
   - Crop 2: HARVESTED (should be yellow)
   - Crop 3: DISEASED (should be red)
2. View on board

**Expected:**
- Each crop text shows in appropriate color
- Visual distinction between statuses

---

### Test 4: Filtered Crops
**Steps:**
1. Create 3 crops: 2 PLANTED, 1 HARVESTED
2. View on board

**Expected:**
- Only PLANTED crops appear
- HARVESTED crop is filtered out (only shows in historical view)

---

### Test 5: No Crops
**Steps:**
1. Create grow area with no crops
2. View on board

**Expected:**
- No crop badge appears
- Dimensions text shows normally
- Grow area looks clean

---

### Test 6: Bucket (Circle) Shape
**Steps:**
1. Create grow area with zoneType: BUCKET
2. Add crops
3. View on board

**Expected:**
- Crop badge centers on circular shape
- Positions correctly below name
- Works same as rectangles

---

### Test 7: Selected State
**Steps:**
1. Create grow area with crops
2. Click to select it

**Expected:**
- Crop badge hides when selected
- Transformer handles show clearly
- Crop badge reappears when deselected

---

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Fetches crops in parallel (Promise.all)
- Filters data client-side (minimal overhead)
- Renders with Konva (hardware-accelerated)
- Limits display to 3 crops (prevents overcrowding)

### Error Handling
- Try-catch per grow area (failures don't break entire page)
- Console warnings for debugging
- Graceful fallback (empty crops array)

### Scalability
- Works with any number of grow areas
- Handles 0 to many crops per area
- "+X more" prevents visual overflow

---

## üéâ Conclusion

Step 27.8 successfully transforms the board view from a simple layout tool into a **living garden visualization**. Users can now see at a glance what's planted where, making the canvas a true garden planning and management tool.

The implementation is performant, type-safe, and follows established patterns. The visual design is clean and informative without cluttering the board. This feature significantly increases the value of the board view for actual gardening use cases.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready  
**Next Steps:** User testing and feedback collection
