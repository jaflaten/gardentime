```

Examples:

- https://www.almanac.com/plant/spinach
- https://www.almanac.com/plant/sweet-potatoes

## Notes

- Some plants may share the same Almanac page (e.g., "Bell peppers" and "Jalapeño peppers" → `/peppers`)
- Verify slug exists on Almanac.com before scraping
- Some specialty items (microgreens) may not have dedicated pages
- Tree fruits may have different data structure than vegetables
